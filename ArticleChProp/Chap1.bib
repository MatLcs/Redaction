	abstract = {From the HISTRHONE database we extracted 1483 hydro-meteorological events from AD 1300 to 2000 that occurred in the Lower Rhône Valley, France. Daily heights of the Rhône River at Beaucaire and Arles are also available, from 1816 and 1829, respectively. A total of 517 floods were divided into three categories and a synthetic frequency severity index (FSI) was computed. Running averages of 11 and 31 years show a succession of poor and rich flood fluctuations. Extreme floods tripled in the second half of the period (1650–2000). Singular spectrum analysis isolates a dominant irregular component (main positive anomalies in 1450–1580, around 1700, late 18th century, and most of the 20th century). We focus on the 17th century, with rare flooding events between two secular so-called “hyper phases”, i.e. frequent and/or severe floods. We also recorded 173 episodes of ice in the river, during the Little Ice Age.},

This place offer a triple advantage: a very good stock of historical records, a recognised stability of the river bed, and a good continuity in the observation of the flood levels by local people and official services. The study of the annual, monthly and decennial distribution of this crues allows the correlation between the frequency of the river's frost and the frequency of the crues over 4 meters. The Little Ice Age (XVIth XIXth centuries) coincide with a frequency of the floods never reached in the twentieth century, with some very critical stages (Late sixteenth century, 1701- 1710, and 1811-1820). A high ratio of the spring and summer in the height of the long and colder stages has also been noted , which is another explanation for the high proportion of recurrent floods that have been noticed.},

Our studies explore a large collection of historical archives in hydrology and hydrometry, found by a historian. This watershed is characterised by an incredible density of hydrological stations, with more than 150 stations and 4500 years of hydrological records, since the beginning of the 20th century. As an example, the archives of 10 stations starting between 1900 and 1917 were very detailed, with all the gaugings, rating curves, and streamflows records. Archives also reveal the great scientific and technical involvement at that period to understand, develop streamflow measurements and estimate available water resources. Then, we present an estimation of streamflow uncertainty of historical series due to the height measurement strategy. Results show that long streamflow series are not homogeneous in time and that old streamflows series could be significantly biased during snowmelt. Finally, this paper shows the great interest of historical time‑series to better characterise hydrometeorological variability.},

	abstract = {Annual maximum ﬂood (AMF) sampling remains the most popular approach to ﬂood frequency analysis. An alternative, the “peaks over threshold” (POT) approach, deals with the selection of over-threshold values. However, the POT approach remains under-employed mainly because of the complexities associated with its use. Among the difﬁculties are the choice of threshold and the selection of criteria for retaining ﬂood peaks. The literature remains sparse and incoherent concerning the various elements and complexities of the POT model. The purpose of the present paper is to shed some light on some of the recurrent and most important questions with regard to the practice of POT modeling, and to make a ﬁrst step in establishing a set of coherent practice-oriented guidelines for the use of the POT model. This paper reviews tests and methods useful for modeling the process of over-threshold values, the choice of the threshold level, the veriﬁcation of the independence of the values and the stationarity of the process, and also presents an application. ᭧ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {The stage-discharge rating curve is subject at many hydrometric stations to sudden changes (shifts) typically caused by morphogenic floods. We propose an original method for estimating shift times using the stage-discharge observations, also known as gaugings. This method is based on a recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties through a Bayesian framework. It starts with the estimation of a baseline rating curve using all available gaugings. Then it computes the residuals between the gaugings and this rating curve with uncertainties. It proceeds with the segmentation of the time series of residuals through a multi-change point Bayesian estimation accounting for residuals uncertainties. Once the first set of shift times is identified, the same procedure is recursively applied to each sub-period through a “top-down” approach searching for all effective shifts. The proposed method is illustrated using the Ardèche River at Meyras in France (a typical hydrometric site subject to river bed degradation) and evaluated using several synthetic data sets for which the true shift times are known. The applications confirm the added value of the recursive segmentation compared with a “single-pass” approach and highlight the importance of properly accounting for uncertainties in the segmented data. The recursive procedure effectively disentangles rating changes from observational and rating curve uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Discharge time series in rivers and streams are usually based on simple stage-discharge relations calibrated using a set of direct stage-discharge measurements called gaugings. Bayesian inference recently emerged as a most promising framework to build such hydrometric rating curves accurately and to estimate the associated uncertainty. In addition to providing the rigorous statistical framework necessary to uncertainty analysis, the main advantage of the Bayesian analysis of rating curves arises from the quantitative assessment of (i) the hydraulic controls that govern the stage-discharge relation, and of (ii) the individual uncertainties of available gaugings, which often diﬀer according to the discharge measurement procedure and the ﬂow conditions. In this paper, we introduce the BaRatin method for the Bayesian analysis of stationary rating curves and we apply it to three typical cases of hydrometric stations with contrasted ﬂow conditions and variable abundance of hydraulic knowledge and gauging data. The results exemplify that the thorough analysis of hydraulic controls and the quantiﬁcation of gauging uncertainties are required to obtain reliable and physically sound results.},

	abstract = {Establishing streamflow time series in unstable rivers is challenged by changes in the stage-discharge relation after floods. Then, the field hydrologist must develop a new stage-discharge rating curve using new calibration data but also using some information from previous calibration data and previous rating curves. The process includes a large amount of informal expert knowledge and hydraulic assumptions seldom made explicit. This paper develops a stage-period-discharge (SPD) model based on the physical interpretation of changes in the stage-discharge relation across a series of stability periods defined by known dates and times. Using simple hydraulic equations, the user provides prior knowledge on the controls, their static and varying parameters, and their possible changes. As a single model is used for all the periods, the estimation of all rating curves can be performed in one go: All gaugings hence provide information to estimate the static parameters and the varying parameters for the relevant periods. Bayesian inference is used, providing a natural way to include prior knowledge and to quantify uncertainty. The generality and some key properties of the method are demonstrated through application to two hydrometric stations, differing in hydraulic configuration and in number and type of changes. Specific experiments demonstrate the ability of the SPD model to transfer information across periods. Consequently, rating curves are more precisely estimated than by separately estimating them for each period. The SPD model provides a hydraulically based, transparent, and user-friendly approach to replace manual shift corrections traditionally applied in operational practice, with a quantification of uncertainties.},

The discharge values obtained from a rating curve include uncertainties related to the direct stage–discharge measurements (gaugings) used to build the curves, the quality of ﬁt of the curve to these measurements and the constant changes in the river bed morphology. Moreover, the uncertainty of discharges estimated from a rating curve increases with the ‘‘age’’ of the rating curve. The level of uncertainty at a given point in time is therefore particularly difﬁcult to assess.},

	abstract = {Stage measurement errors are generally overlooked when streamﬂow time series are derived from uncertain rating curves. We introduce an original method for propagating stage uncertainties due to two types of stage measurement errors: (i) errors of the stage read during the gauging and (ii) systematic and nonsystematic (independent) errors of the recorded stage time series. The error models are generic and can be used for any probabilistic rating curve estimation method that provides an ensemble of rating curves. The new method is applied to a range of six contrasting hydrometric stations in France. Uncertainty budgets quantifying the contribution of various error sources to the total streamﬂow uncertainty are computed and compared for streamﬂow time series averaged at time intervals from hour to year. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the stage time series error model to identify the most sensitive parameters. The results are site speciﬁc, which illustrates the key role played by the properties of both the hydrometric site and the gauged catchment. Across the range of sites, stage errors of the gaugings are found to have limited impact on rating curve uncertainty, at least for gaugings performed in fair conditions. Nonsystematic errors in the stage time series have a negligible effect, generally. However, systematic stage errors should not be neglected. Over the six hydrometric stations in this study, the 95\% uncertainty component reﬂecting stage systematic errors (from 60.5 cm to 66.8 cm) alone ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average streamﬂow, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average streamﬂow as sensors were assumed to be recalibrated every 30 days. Perspectives for improving and validating the streamﬂow uncertainty estimation techniques are eventually discussed.},

With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

Such design ﬂood estimation techniques often ignore the uncertainty in the underlying rating curve model. Using data from eight gauging stations in Norway, we investigate the effect of curve and sample uncertainty on design ﬂood estimation by combining results from a Bayesian multisegment rating curve model and a Bayesian ﬂood frequency analysis. We ﬁnd that sample uncertainty is the main contributor to the design ﬂood estimation uncertainty. However, under extrapolation of the rating curve, the uncertainty bounds for both the rating curve model and the ﬂood frequency analysis are highly skewed and ignoring these features may underestimate the potential risk of ﬂooding. We expect this effect to be even more pronounced in arid and semiarid climates with a higher variability in ﬂoods.},

The analysis is performed with wave-height data recorded off the Spanish Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) and wave-height data from the Dutch coast (North Sea). An analysis with natural-scale and log-transformed wave-height time series has been performed. This scale selection is proven to be advantageous for naturally bounded variables and also better captures some distribution features. The paper ends with a discussion on how the different techniques can be used to select a statistically robust threshold for an extreme event deﬁnition.

In this work, we propose a regional Bayesian model for short record length sites. This model is less restrictive than the Index Flood model while preserving the formalism of “homogeneous regions”. Performance of the proposed model is assessed on a set of gauging stations in France. The accuracy of quantile estimates as a function of homogeneousness level of the pooling group is also analysed. Results indicate that the regional Bayesian model outperforms the Index Flood model and local estimators. Furthermore, it seems that working with relatively large and homogeneous regions may lead to more accurate results than working with smaller and highly homogeneous regions.},

	volume = {54},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1029/ 2018WR022708},
	abstract = {Streamﬂow time series are commonly derived from stage-discharge rating curves, but the uncertainty of the rating curve and resulting streamﬂow series are poorly understood. While different methods to quantify uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship exist, there is limited understanding of how uncertainty estimates differ between methods due to different assumptions and methodological choices. We compared uncertainty estimates and stage-discharge rating curves from seven methods at three river locations of varying hydraulic complexity. Comparison of the estimated uncertainties revealed a wide range of estimates, particularly for high and low ﬂows. At the simplest site on the Isère River (France), full width 95\% uncertainties for the different methods ranged from 3 to 17\% for median ﬂows. In contrast, uncertainties were much higher and ranged from 41 to 200\% for high ﬂows in an extrapolated section of the rating curve at the Mahurangi River (New Zealand) and 28 to 101\% for low ﬂows at the Taf River (United Kingdom), where the hydraulic control is unstable at low ﬂows. Differences between methods result from differences in the sources of uncertainty considered, differences in the handling of the time-varying nature of rating curves, differences in the extent of hydraulic knowledge assumed, and differences in assumptions when extrapolating rating curves above or below the observed gaugings. Ultimately, the selection of an uncertainty method requires a match between user requirements and the assumptions made by the uncertainty method. Given the signiﬁcant differences in uncertainty estimates between methods, we suggest that a clear statement of uncertainty assumptions be presented alongside streamﬂow uncertainty estimates. Plain Language Summary Knowledge of the uncertainty in streamﬂow discharge measured at gauging stations is important for water management applications and scientiﬁc analysis. This paper shows that uncertainty estimates vary widely (typically up to a factor of 4) when comparing seven recently introduced estimation methods. A clear understanding of the assumptions underpinning different uncertainty estimation methods and the sources of uncertainty included in their calculations is needed when selecting a method and using and presenting its uncertainty estimates.},

	abstract = {This review and commentary sets out the need for authoritative and concise information on the expected error distributions and magnitudes in observational data. We discuss the necessary components of a benchmark of dominant data uncertainties and the recent developments in hydrology which increase the need for such guidance. We initiate the creation of a catalogue of accessible information on characteristics of data uncertainty for the key hydrological variables of rainfall, river discharge and water quality (suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen). This includes demonstration of how uncertainties can be quantiﬁed, summarizing current knowledge and the standard quantitative results available. In particular, synthesis of results from multiple studies allows conclusions to be drawn on factors which control the magnitude of data uncertainty and hence improves provision of prior guidance on those uncertainties. Rainfall uncertainties were found to be driven by spatial scale, whereas river discharge uncertainty was dominated by ﬂow condition and gauging method. Water quality variables presented a more complex picture with many component errors. For all variables, it was easy to ﬁnd examples where relative error magnitudes exceeded 40\%. We consider how data uncertainties impact on the interpretation of catchment dynamics, model regionalization and model evaluation. In closing the review, we make recommendations for future research priorities in quantifying data uncertainty and highlight the need for an improved ‘culture of engagement’ with observational uncertainties.

	abstract = {Uncertainty in hydrometric data is a fact of life. Basic assumptions about the nature of this uncertainty are necessary in every analysis of hydrometric data, and an understanding of the variability of uncertainty can facilitate the effective use of hydrologic information. For most of the twentieth century there has been little change in hydrometric methods and many analysts explicitly or implicitly assume that the uncertainty has not changed over the period of record. We argue that there is substantial variability in the magnitude of uncertainty in published streamflow records that is not transparent to data users. Quantifying uncertainty is particularly important in the context of the current changes in hydrometric technology and in the increasing integration of data sets from multiple providers. We recommend best practices for identifying uncertainty in field notes and propagating that observational uncertainty through the data production process. We suggest both field and reanalysis studies that could be undertaken to improve understanding of hydrometric uncertainty. We also recommend improvements in management practices, including preservation of relevant metadata and a suitable period of overlap for new and old observing systems to allow assessment of the effects of changing technology.},

The present work discusses the impact of inaccurate head measurement on observed instantaneous ﬂood discharge. The sources and sizes of uncertainties in head determination are discussed. A simple uncertainty model is developed in order to quantify the uncertainty in error-corrupted instantaneous and mean discharge. It is shown that uncertainty in mean discharge is less affected by uncorrelated head measurement error, while instantaneous discharges are substantially affected. Practical modelling using data from a Norwegian urban gauging station is undertaken. It is shown that the estimated annual maximum instantaneous ﬂood discharge from this watershed has 95\% conﬁdence limits with sizes of 17 – 19\% of the estimated discharge for average head measurement accuracy. Furthermore, it is shown that variability in head determination causes only a minor potential for bias in estimated instantaneous ﬂood population statistics and quantiles.},

Estimating the uncertainty of discharge measurements is necessary to make consistent decisions. Although discharge measurement techniques have improved in recent decades, uncertainty analysis remains a challenge in hydrometry due to the lack of discharge standards in the field. This study aims at estimating the uncertainty of velocity‑area discharge measurements with potential perspective of updating the ISO 748 standard. To address the limitations of existing methods, this study presents a new analytical propagation method, called Flaure, to estimate the uncertainty components. Special attention is paid to the estimation of the dominant u’m component related to cross‑sectional interpolation errors of velocities and depths. High‑resolution reference gaugings are used to assess the uncertainty component through a statistical analysis. The method then establishes an explicit link between the estimation of cross‑sectional interpolation errors and a sampling quality index that can be computed for any given current‑meter discharge measurement.},

The work herein explores this intersection, with consideration of a long-term discharge response (1964–2007) for a {\textasciitilde}650-km2 headwater basin of the Mara River in west Kenya, starting with stream rating and daily gauge height data. A rating model was calibrated using Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainty intervals in model parameters and predictions. There was an unknown balance of random and systemic error in rating data scatter (a scenario not likely unique to this basin), which led to an unknown balance of noise and information in the calibrated statistical error model. This had implications on testing for hydrological change. Overall, indications were that shifts in basin’s discharge response were rather subtle over the 44-year period. A null hypothesis for change using ﬂow duration curves (FDCs) from four different 8-year data intervals could be either accepted or rejected over much of the net ﬂow domain depending on different applications of the statistical error model (each with precedence in the literature). The only unambiguous indication of change in FDC comparisons appeared to be a reduction in lowest baseﬂow in recent years (ﬂows with {\textgreater}98\% exceedance probability). We deﬁned a subjective uncertainty interval based on an intermediate balance of random and systematic error in the rating model that suggested a possibility of more prevalent impacts. These results have relevance to management in the Mara basin and to future studies that might establish linkages to historic land use and climatic factors. The concern about uncertain uncertainty intervals (uncertainty2) extends beyond the Mara and is relevant to testing change where non-random rating errors may be important and subtle responses are investigated.

There is a wide variety of techniques to assess discharge uncertainty. However, few studies have developed generalized approaches to quantify discharge uncertainty. This study presents a generalized framework for estimating discharge uncertainty at many gauging stations with different errors in the stage-discharge relationship. The methodology utilizes a nonparametric LOWESS regression within a novel framework that accounts for uncertainty in the stagedischarge measurements, scatter in the stage-discharge data and multisection rating curves. The framework was applied to 500 gauging stations in England and Wales and we evaluated the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at low, mean and high ﬂow points on the rating curve. The framework was shown to be robust, versatile and able to capture place-speciﬁc uncertainties for a number of different examples. Our study revealed a wide range of discharge uncertainties (10–397\% discharge uncertainty interval widths), but the majority of the gauging stations (over 80\%) had mean and high ﬂow uncertainty intervals of less than 40\%. We identiﬁed some regional differences in the stage-discharge relationships, however the results show that local conditions dominated in determining the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at a gauging station. This highlights the importance of estimating discharge uncertainty for each gauging station prior to using those data in hydrological analyses.},

First, a summary of the main difficulties encountered in extrapolating rating curves for flood discharge is provided. Then a sensitivity analysis is carried out using a hydraulic modelling approach, applied to eight Mediterranean catchments, and yielding an envelope curve for the stage–discharge relationship, Q(H). To assess the influence of errors in the flood discharge on the uncertainty in estimating extreme floods, a Bayesian framework including a multiplicative error on the rating curve was applied. Its application on two catchments for which historical data are available for the period (1741–2004) shows that ignoring the rating curve errors may lead to an unduly optimistic reduction in the final uncertainty in estimation of flood discharge quantiles. Moreover, the quantile values are also affected by taking into account the rating curve errors.},

This uncertainty stems from two types of error: (a) random errors related to the water-level readings; and (b) systematic errors related to over- or under-estimation of the rating curve. A Bayesian frequency analysis is performed to take both sources of uncertainty into account. It is shown that the uncertainty affecting discharges should be carefully evaluated and taken into account in the flood frequency analysis, as it can increase the quantiles confidence interval.

	abstract = {Maximum flows are often estimated from flood frequency analysis, by means of the statistical fitting of a theoretical probability distribution to maximum annual flow data. However, because of the limitations imposed by the practice of at-site flow measurement, empirical models are applied as the rating curve for estimating streamflow. These curves are approximations of the actual flows and incorporate different sources of uncertainty, especially in the extrapolation portions. These uncertainties are propagated in the frequency analysis and influence the estimated quantiles. For better understanding and describing the influence of the stage-discharge uncertainty in this process, the results of Bayesian rating curve modeling, which considers the physical knowledge of the gauging station as prior information, were combined with Bayesian flood frequency analysis under asymptotic extreme value theory. The method was applied to the Acorizal stream gauging station, located in the interior of the state of Mato Grosso - BR. The main results suggested that, although the uncertainties of the rating curve can be relevant in the estimation of maximum flow quantiles, the uncertainties arising from finite-sample inference might exert greater impacts on the flow credibility intervals even for moderate sample sizes.},

A novel likelihood-based framework is developed for this purpose, assuming a power-law model for the stage-discharge measurements and a generalised extreme value (GEV) model for the annual maximum discharges. It is shown that the two models can be pooled into one likelihood function. This allows for simultaneous estimation of the rating curve and GEV parameters, and the assessment of the uncertainty of a T-year ﬂood estimate due to both sample variability and rating curve imprecision. Sampling experiments show that (1) the novel method is computationally feasible and little affected by estimation bias, and (2) the chief effect of rating curve imprecision is to inﬂate the estimation variability of the GEV quantile estimates. The application of the method to data from 12 Norwegian gauging stations illustrates that (3) the novel and traditional methods give very similar rating curve and GEV parameter estimates and (4) the net effect of sample variability and rating curve imprecision can give rise to signiﬁcant wide conﬁdence intervals for the estimated T-year ﬂood.},

The trends of riverbed changes during the study period at the selected gauging stations were calculated based on the variability of observed minimal annual water stages. The reasons for the observed changes in the river course and channel geometry are given. These changes were caused by river regulation consisted of the shortening and narrowing of the river channel. Moreover, grain size distribution analysis in the selected gauging stations of Nida River and characteristic diameter variability of sediments along the river course examination are presented. These analyses were to evaluate the variability of characteristic diameters along the river course in connection with observed changes in cross-sections’ geometry. Additionally, to confirm the process of erosion or deposition recognized in the examined river channels, hydrodynamic equilibrium was determined. Three methods were proposed and used: the mean velocity and critical velocity in the main river channel comparison, the stream power value calculation which defines the character of the river channel, and the WWK (index of cutting or shallowing of the river channel) index.},

	abstract = {Although discharge estimations are central for water management and hydropower, there are few studies on the variability and uncertainty of their basis; deriving discharge from stage heights through the use of a rating curve that depends on riverbed geometry. A large fraction of the world’s river-discharge stations are presumably located in alluvial channels where riverbed characteristics may change over time because of erosion and sedimentation. This study was conducted to analyse and quantify the dynamic relationship between stage and discharge and to determine to what degree currently used methods are able to account for such variability. The study was carried out for six hydrometric stations in the upper Choluteca River basin, Honduras, where a set of unusually frequent stage–discharge data are available. The temporal variability and the uncertainty of the rating curve and its parameters were analysed through a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis on a moving window of data using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Acceptable ranges for the values of the rating-curve parameters were determined from riverbed surveys at the six stations, and the sampling space was constrained according to those ranges, using three-dimensional alpha shapes. Temporal variability was analysed in three ways: (i) with annually updated rating curves (simulating Honduran practices), (ii) a rating curve for each time window, and (iii) a smoothed, continuous dynamic rating curve derived from the MC analysis. The temporal variability of the rating parameters translated into a high rating-curve variability. The variability could turn out as increasing or decreasing trends and/or cyclic behaviour. There was a tendency at all stations to a seasonal variability. The discharge at a given stage could vary by a factor of two or more. The quotient in discharge volumes estimated from dynamic and static rating curves varied between 0.5 and 1.5. The difference between discharge volumes derived from static and dynamic curves was largest for sub-daily ratings but stayed large also for monthly and yearly totals. The relative uncertainty was largest for low ﬂows but it was considerable also for intermediate and large ﬂows. The standard procedure of adjusting rating curves when calculated and observed discharge differ by more than 5\% would have required continuously updated rating curves at the studied locations. We believe that these ﬁndings can be applicable to many other discharge stations around the globe.},

One way of checking the reliability of a climate series is to compare it with surrounding stations. This is the idea behind all tests of the relative homogeneity. Here we will present a simple homogeneity test and apply it to a precipitation data set from south-western Sweden. More precisely we will apply it to ratios between station values and some reference values. The reference value is a form of a mean value from surrounding stations. It is found valuable to include short and incomplete series in the reference value. The test can be used as an instrument for quality control as far as the mean level of, for instance, precipitation is concerned. In practice it should be used along with the available station history. Several non-homogeneities are present in these series and probably reflect a serious source of uncertainty in studies of climatic trends and climatic change all over the world. The significant breaks varied from 5 to 25 per cent for this data set. An example illustrates the importance of using relevant climatic normals that refer to the present measurement conditions in constructing maps of anomalies.},

Presented here are techniques that are suitable in the face of the complications listed above for the exploratory analysis of monthly water quality data for monotonie trends. The first procedure described is a nonparametric test for trend applicable to data sets with seasonality, missing values, or values reported as ‘less than’: the seasonal Kendall test. Under realistic stochastic processes (exhibiting seasonality, skewness, and serial correlation), it is robust in comparison to parametric alternatives, although neither the seasonal Kendall test nor the alternatives can be considered an exact test in the presence of serial correlation. The second procedure, the seasonal Kendall slope estimator, is an estimator of trend magnitude. It is an unbiased estimator of the slope of a linear trend and has considerably higher precision than a regression estimator where data are highly skewed but somewhat lower precision where the data are normal. The third procedure provides a means for testing for change over time in the relationship between constituent concentration and flow, thus avoiding the problem of identifying trends in water quality that are artifacts of the particular sequence of discharges observed (e.g., drought effects). In this method a flow-adjusted concentration is defined as the residual (actual minus conditional expectation) based on a regression of concentration on some function of discharge. These flow-adjusted concentrations, which may also be seasonal and non-normal, can then be tested for trend by using the seasonal Kendall test.},

	abstract = {Les séries temporelles de débit des rivières sont établies à l'aide de "courbes de tarage", qui sont des modèles avec les hauteurs d’eau en entrée et les débits en sortie. Malheureusement, de nombreuses stations hydrométriques ont une relation hauteur-débit instable, notamment à cause de l’évolution du lit de la rivière lors des crues. Ces "détarages" posent problème à la fois pour l'établissement des séries hydrologiques de long-terme (analyse rétrospective) et pour la fourniture de données en temps réel, par exemple pour la prévision des inondations, avec des incertitudes quantifiées et fiables. Les méthodes existantes pour la mise à jour de la courbe de tarage sont basées sur une analyse statistique des données de calibration (jaugeages) passées ou sur des règles empiriques. Cette thèse a permis de développer des méthodes originales pour la détection automatique des détarages et l'estimation de leur amplitude en rétrospectif et en temps réel : une méthode de segmentation des résidus entre les jaugeages et une courbe de référence, une analyse des récessions du limnigramme et une détection de détarages potentiels à partir d'un indicateur disponible en temps réel (par exemple, transport sédimentaire cumulé). L'approche probabiliste permet d'une part de prendre en compte l'incertitude des informations sur les détarages et d'autre part de quantifier les incertitudes sur les débits calculés. La combinaison des trois méthodes a été appliquée à la station de l’Ardèche à Meyras, en France, qui présente des détarages nets après chaque crue importante. Une bonne détection et estimation des détarages a été observée en rétrospectif et en temps réel. La méthode est générale et applicable en opérationnel à d’autres stations après validation. La méthode est générique et, après davantage de validation, applicable en opérationnel à d'autres sites.},

	abstract = {Regional flood frequency analysis is a convenient way to reduce estimation uncertainty when few data are available at the gauging site. In this work, a model that allows a non-null probability to a regional fixed shape parameter is presented. This methodology is integrated within a Bayesian framework and uses reversible jump techniques. The performance on stochastic data of this new estimator is compared to two other models: a conventional Bayesian analysis and the index flood approach. Results show that the proposed estimator is absolutely suited to regional estimation when only a few data are available at the target site. Moreover, unlike the index flood estimator, target site index flood error estimation seems to have less impact on Bayesian estimators. Some suggestions about configurations of the pooling groups are also presented to increase the performance of each estimator.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern that ﬂooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of ﬂood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on ﬂood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The ﬁrst approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed ﬂood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future ﬂoods. Challenges and opportunities associated with ﬂood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in ﬂood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and ﬂood-rich and ﬂoodpoor periods rather than on short duration ﬂood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed ﬂood changes, by validating scenarios against observed ﬂood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of ﬂood changes and feedbacks. The paper ﬁnishes with a call for a joint European ﬂood change research network.},

The study shows that despite widespread consensus in the scientiﬁc literature on the utility of documentary evidence, the actual migration from academic to practical application has been limited. A detailed review of ﬂood frequency estimation guidelines from diﬀerent countries showed that the value of historical data is generally recognised, but practical methods for systematic and routine inclusion of this type of data into risk analysis are in most cases not available. Studies of historical events were identiﬁed in most countries, and good examples of national databases attempting to collate the available information were identiﬁed. The conclusion is that there is considerable potential for improving the reliability of the current ﬂood risk assessments by harvesting the valuable information on past extreme events contained in the historical data sets.},

It is a significant tool for the study of flood risk. Basic sources of documentary data on floods and methods of data collection and analysis are discussed. Research progress achieved in Europe in reconstructing past runoff conditions, hydrological and hydraulic analyses of historical floods, their meteorological causes, impacts and relation to climate change, as well as use of combined series of palaeofloods, instrumental and historical floods for reconstructing long-term flood records, is reviewed.

A list of historical ﬂood levels from 1644 to the present has been drawn up and converted into discharge using hydraulic modelling. A sensitivity analysis provides error intervals on discharge estimates taking into account uncertainties on water level, roughness coefﬁcient and channel geometry, and the impact of a nonpermanent discharge or the backward effect. A ﬂood frequency analysis using systematic and nonsystematic data gives a practical example on how historical information can improve ﬂood knowledge. It reduces the sampling uncertainty and shows also a good agreement with a hydrometeorological approach (Gradex model).},

The review summaries methods and methodologies applied and key findings from a large number of studies. Reported analyses of observed extreme precipitation and flood records show that there is some evidence of a general increase in extreme precipitation, whereas there are no clear indications of significant trends at large-scale regional or national level of extreme streamflow. Several studies from regions dominated by snowmelt-induced peak flows report decreases in extreme streamflow and earlier spring snowmelt peak flows, likely caused by increasing temperature. The review of likely future changes based on climate projections indicates a general increase in extreme precipitation under a future climate, which is consistent with the observed trends. Hydrological projections of peak flows show large impacts in many areas with both positive and negative changes. A general decrease in flood magnitude and earlier spring floods are projected for catchments with snowmelt-dominated peak flows, which is consistent with the observed trends. Finally, existing guidelines in Europe on design flood and design rainfall estimation are reviewed. The review shows that only few countries have developed guidelines that incorporate a consideration of climate change impacts.},
