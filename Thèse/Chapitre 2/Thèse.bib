	abstract = {From the {HISTRHONE} database we extracted 1483 hydro-meteorological events from {AD} 1300 to 2000 that occurred in the Lower Rhône Valley, France. Daily heights of the Rhône River at Beaucaire and Arles are also available, from 1816 and 1829, respectively. A total of 517 floods were divided into three categories and a synthetic frequency severity index ({FSI}) was computed. Running averages of 11 and 31 years show a succession of poor and rich flood fluctuations. Extreme floods tripled in the second half of the period (1650–2000). Singular spectrum analysis isolates a dominant irregular component (main positive anomalies in 1450–1580, around 1700, late 18th century, and most of the 20th century). We focus on the 17th century, with rare flooding events between two secular so-called “hyper phases”, i.e. frequent and/or severe floods. We also recorded 173 episodes of ice in the river, during the Little Ice Age.},

This place offer a triple advantage: a very good stock of historical records, a recognised stability of the river bed, and a good continuity in the observation of the flood levels by local people and official services. The study of the annual, monthly and decennial distribution of this crues allows the correlation between the frequency of the river's frost and the frequency of the crues over 4 meters. The Little Ice Age ({XVIth} {XIXth} centuries) coincide with a frequency of the floods never reached in the twentieth century, with some very critical stages (Late sixteenth century, 1701- 1710, and 1811-1820). A high ratio of the spring and summer in the height of the long and colder stages has also been noted , which is another explanation for the high proportion of recurrent floods that have been noticed.},

Our studies explore a large collection of historical archives in hydrology and hydrometry, found by a historian. This watershed is characterised by an incredible density of hydrological stations, with more than 150 stations and 4500 years of hydrological records, since the beginning of the 20th century. As an example, the archives of 10 stations starting between 1900 and 1917 were very detailed, with all the gaugings, rating curves, and streamflows records. Archives also reveal the great scientific and technical involvement at that period to understand, develop streamflow measurements and estimate available water resources. Then, we present an estimation of streamflow uncertainty of historical series due to the height measurement strategy. Results show that long streamflow series are not homogeneous in time and that old streamflows series could be significantly biased during snowmelt. Finally, this paper shows the great interest of historical time‑series to better characterise hydrometeorological variability.},

	abstract = {Annual maximum ﬂood ({AMF}) sampling remains the most popular approach to ﬂood frequency analysis. An alternative, the “peaks over threshold” ({POT}) approach, deals with the selection of over-threshold values. However, the {POT} approach remains under-employed mainly because of the complexities associated with its use. Among the difﬁculties are the choice of threshold and the selection of criteria for retaining ﬂood peaks. The literature remains sparse and incoherent concerning the various elements and complexities of the {POT} model. The purpose of the present paper is to shed some light on some of the recurrent and most important questions with regard to the practice of {POT} modeling, and to make a ﬁrst step in establishing a set of coherent practice-oriented guidelines for the use of the {POT} model. This paper reviews tests and methods useful for modeling the process of over-threshold values, the choice of the threshold level, the veriﬁcation of the independence of the values and the stationarity of the process, and also presents an application. ᭧ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {The stage-discharge rating curve is subject at many hydrometric stations to sudden changes (shifts) typically caused by morphogenic floods. We propose an original method for estimating shift times using the stage-discharge observations, also known as gaugings. This method is based on a recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties through a Bayesian framework. It starts with the estimation of a baseline rating curve using all available gaugings. Then it computes the residuals between the gaugings and this rating curve with uncertainties. It proceeds with the segmentation of the time series of residuals through a multi-change point Bayesian estimation accounting for residuals uncertainties. Once the first set of shift times is identified, the same procedure is recursively applied to each sub-period through a “top-down” approach searching for all effective shifts. The proposed method is illustrated using the Ardèche River at Meyras in France (a typical hydrometric site subject to river bed degradation) and evaluated using several synthetic data sets for which the true shift times are known. The applications confirm the added value of the recursive segmentation compared with a “single-pass” approach and highlight the importance of properly accounting for uncertainties in the segmented data. The recursive procedure effectively disentangles rating changes from observational and rating curve uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Discharge time series in rivers and streams are usually based on simple stage-discharge relations calibrated using a set of direct stage-discharge measurements called gaugings. Bayesian inference recently emerged as a most promising framework to build such hydrometric rating curves accurately and to estimate the associated uncertainty. In addition to providing the rigorous statistical framework necessary to uncertainty analysis, the main advantage of the Bayesian analysis of rating curves arises from the quantitative assessment of (i) the hydraulic controls that govern the stage-discharge relation, and of (ii) the individual uncertainties of available gaugings, which often diﬀer according to the discharge measurement procedure and the ﬂow conditions. In this paper, we introduce the {BaRatin} method for the Bayesian analysis of stationary rating curves and we apply it to three typical cases of hydrometric stations with contrasted ﬂow conditions and variable abundance of hydraulic knowledge and gauging data. The results exemplify that the thorough analysis of hydraulic controls and the quantiﬁcation of gauging uncertainties are required to obtain reliable and physically sound results.},

	abstract = {Establishing streamflow time series in unstable rivers is challenged by changes in the stage-discharge relation after floods. Then, the field hydrologist must develop a new stage-discharge rating curve using new calibration data but also using some information from previous calibration data and previous rating curves. The process includes a large amount of informal expert knowledge and hydraulic assumptions seldom made explicit. This paper develops a stage-period-discharge ({SPD}) model based on the physical interpretation of changes in the stage-discharge relation across a series of stability periods defined by known dates and times. Using simple hydraulic equations, the user provides prior knowledge on the controls, their static and varying parameters, and their possible changes. As a single model is used for all the periods, the estimation of all rating curves can be performed in one go: All gaugings hence provide information to estimate the static parameters and the varying parameters for the relevant periods. Bayesian inference is used, providing a natural way to include prior knowledge and to quantify uncertainty. The generality and some key properties of the method are demonstrated through application to two hydrometric stations, differing in hydraulic configuration and in number and type of changes. Specific experiments demonstrate the ability of the {SPD} model to transfer information across periods. Consequently, rating curves are more precisely estimated than by separately estimating them for each period. The {SPD} model provides a hydraulically based, transparent, and user-friendly approach to replace manual shift corrections traditionally applied in operational practice, with a quantification of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Stage measurement errors are generally overlooked when streamﬂow time series are derived from uncertain rating curves. We introduce an original method for propagating stage uncertainties due to two types of stage measurement errors: (i) errors of the stage read during the gauging and (ii) systematic and nonsystematic (independent) errors of the recorded stage time series. The error models are generic and can be used for any probabilistic rating curve estimation method that provides an ensemble of rating curves. The new method is applied to a range of six contrasting hydrometric stations in France. Uncertainty budgets quantifying the contribution of various error sources to the total streamﬂow uncertainty are computed and compared for streamﬂow time series averaged at time intervals from hour to year. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the stage time series error model to identify the most sensitive parameters. The results are site speciﬁc, which illustrates the key role played by the properties of both the hydrometric site and the gauged catchment. Across the range of sites, stage errors of the gaugings are found to have limited impact on rating curve uncertainty, at least for gaugings performed in fair conditions. Nonsystematic errors in the stage time series have a negligible effect, generally. However, systematic stage errors should not be neglected. Over the six hydrometric stations in this study, the 95\% uncertainty component reﬂecting stage systematic errors (from 60.5 cm to 66.8 cm) alone ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average streamﬂow, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average streamﬂow as sensors were assumed to be recalibrated every 30 days. Perspectives for improving and validating the streamﬂow uncertainty estimation techniques are eventually discussed.},

The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

We ﬁnd that sample uncertainty is the main contributor to the design ﬂood estimation uncertainty. However, under extrapolation of the rating curve, the uncertainty bounds for both the rating curve model and the ﬂood frequency analysis are highly skewed and ignoring these features may underestimate the potential risk of ﬂooding. We expect this effect to be even more pronounced in arid and semiarid climates with a higher variability in ﬂoods.},

The analysis is performed with wave-height data recorded off the Spanish Catalan coast ({NW} Mediterranean) and wave-height data from the Dutch coast (North Sea). An analysis with natural-scale and log-transformed wave-height time series has been performed. This scale selection is proven to be advantageous for naturally bounded variables and also better captures some distribution features. The paper ends with a discussion on how the different techniques can be used to select a statistically robust threshold for an extreme event deﬁnition.

However, when the local data series is short, frequency analysis results become unreliable. Regional frequency analysis is a convenient way to reduce the estimation uncertainty. In this work, we propose a regional Bayesian model for short record length sites. This model is less restrictive than the Index Flood model while preserving the formalism of “homogeneous regions”. Performance of the proposed model is assessed on a set of gauging stations in France. The accuracy of quantile estimates as a function of homogeneousness level of the pooling group is also analysed. Results indicate that the regional Bayesian model outperforms the Index Flood model and local estimators. Furthermore, it seems that working with relatively large and homogeneous regions may lead to more accurate results than working with smaller and highly homogeneous regions.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1029/ 2018WR022708},
	abstract = {Streamﬂow time series are commonly derived from stage-discharge rating curves, but the uncertainty of the rating curve and resulting streamﬂow series are poorly understood. While different methods to quantify uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship exist, there is limited understanding of how uncertainty estimates differ between methods due to different assumptions and methodological choices. We compared uncertainty estimates and stage-discharge rating curves from seven methods at three river locations of varying hydraulic complexity. Comparison of the estimated uncertainties revealed a wide range of estimates, particularly for high and low ﬂows. At the simplest site on the Isère River (France), full width 95\% uncertainties for the different methods ranged from 3 to 17\% for median ﬂows. In contrast, uncertainties were much higher and ranged from 41 to 200\% for high ﬂows in an extrapolated section of the rating curve at the Mahurangi River (New Zealand) and 28 to 101\% for low ﬂows at the Taf River (United Kingdom), where the hydraulic control is unstable at low ﬂows. Differences between methods result from differences in the sources of uncertainty considered, differences in the handling of the time-varying nature of rating curves, differences in the extent of hydraulic knowledge assumed, and differences in assumptions when extrapolating rating curves above or below the observed gaugings. Ultimately, the selection of an uncertainty method requires a match between user requirements and the assumptions made by the uncertainty method. Given the signiﬁcant differences in uncertainty estimates between methods, we suggest that a clear statement of uncertainty assumptions be presented alongside streamﬂow uncertainty estimates. Plain Language Summary Knowledge of the uncertainty in streamﬂow discharge measured at gauging stations is important for water management applications and scientiﬁc analysis. This paper shows that uncertainty estimates vary widely (typically up to a factor of 4) when comparing seven recently introduced estimation methods. A clear understanding of the assumptions underpinning different uncertainty estimation methods and the sources of uncertainty included in their calculations is needed when selecting a method and using and presenting its uncertainty estimates.},

	abstract = {This review and commentary sets out the need for authoritative and concise information on the expected error distributions and magnitudes in observational data. We discuss the necessary components of a benchmark of dominant data uncertainties and the recent developments in hydrology which increase the need for such guidance. We initiate the creation of a catalogue of accessible information on characteristics of data uncertainty for the key hydrological variables of rainfall, river discharge and water quality (suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen). This includes demonstration of how uncertainties can be quantiﬁed, summarizing current knowledge and the standard quantitative results available. In particular, synthesis of results from multiple studies allows conclusions to be drawn on factors which control the magnitude of data uncertainty and hence improves provision of prior guidance on those uncertainties. Rainfall uncertainties were found to be driven by spatial scale, whereas river discharge uncertainty was dominated by ﬂow condition and gauging method. Water quality variables presented a more complex picture with many component errors. For all variables, it was easy to ﬁnd examples where relative error magnitudes exceeded 40\%. We consider how data uncertainties impact on the interpretation of catchment dynamics, model regionalization and model evaluation. In closing the review, we make recommendations for future research priorities in quantifying data uncertainty and highlight the need for an improved ‘culture of engagement’ with observational uncertainties.

Basic assumptions about the nature of this uncertainty are necessary in every analysis of hydrometric data, and an understanding of the variability of uncertainty can facilitate the effective use of hydrologic information. For most of the twentieth century there has been little change in hydrometric methods and many analysts explicitly or implicitly assume that the uncertainty has not changed over the period of record. We argue that there is substantial variability in the magnitude of uncertainty in published streamflow records that is not transparent to data users. Quantifying uncertainty is particularly important in the context of the current changes in hydrometric technology and in the increasing integration of data sets from multiple providers. We recommend best practices for identifying uncertainty in field notes and propagating that observational uncertainty through the data production process. We suggest both field and reanalysis studies that could be undertaken to improve understanding of hydrometric uncertainty.

The present work discusses the impact of inaccurate head measurement on observed instantaneous ﬂood discharge. The sources and sizes of uncertainties in head determination are discussed. A simple uncertainty model is developed in order to quantify the uncertainty in error-corrupted instantaneous and mean discharge. It is shown that uncertainty in mean discharge is less affected by uncorrelated head measurement error, while instantaneous discharges are substantially affected. Practical modelling using data from a Norwegian urban gauging station is undertaken. It is shown that the estimated annual maximum instantaneous ﬂood discharge from this watershed has 95\% conﬁdence limits with sizes of 17 – 19\% of the estimated discharge for average head measurement accuracy. Furthermore, it is shown that variability in head determination causes only a minor potential for bias in estimated instantaneous ﬂood population statistics and quantiles.},

As a result, the data set of measured discharges could be extended by approximately 600 years. The study shows that historic ﬂood events decrease the conﬁdence interval of the ﬂood frequency curve signiﬁcantly, speciﬁcally in the range of large ﬂoods.

Discharge extrapolations to the edges and in the top/bottom layers are explicitly taken into account, as well as the distribution of the verticals throughout the cross-section.

Estimating the uncertainty of discharge measurements is necessary to make consistent decisions. Although discharge measurement techniques have improved in recent decades, uncertainty analysis remains a challenge in hydrometry due to the lack of discharge standards in the field. This study aims at estimating the uncertainty of velocity‑area discharge measurements with potential perspective of updating the {ISO} 748 standard. To address the limitations of existing methods, this study presents a new analytical propagation method, called Flaure, to estimate the uncertainty components. Special attention is paid to the estimation of the dominant u’m component related to cross‑sectional interpolation errors of velocities and depths. High‑resolution reference gaugings are used to assess the uncertainty component through a statistical analysis. The method then establishes an explicit link between the estimation of cross‑sectional interpolation errors and a sampling quality index that can be computed for any given current‑meter discharge measurement.},

	abstract = {The intersection of the developing topic of rating curve and discharge series uncertainty with the topic of hydrological change detection (e.g., in response to land cover or climatic change) has not yet been well studied. The work herein explores this intersection, with consideration of a long-term discharge response (1964–2007) for a {\textasciitilde}650-km2 headwater basin of the Mara River in west Kenya, starting with stream rating and daily gauge height data. A rating model was calibrated using Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainty intervals in model parameters and predictions. There was an unknown balance of random and systemic error in rating data scatter (a scenario not likely unique to this basin), which led to an unknown balance of noise and information in the calibrated statistical error model. This had implications on testing for hydrological change. Overall, indications were that shifts in basin’s discharge response were rather subtle over the 44-year period. A null hypothesis for change using ﬂow duration curves ({FDCs}) from four different 8-year data intervals could be either accepted or rejected over much of the net ﬂow domain depending on different applications of the statistical error model (each with precedence in the literature). The only unambiguous indication of change in {FDC} comparisons appeared to be a reduction in lowest baseﬂow in recent years (ﬂows with {\textgreater}98\% exceedance probability). We deﬁned a subjective uncertainty interval based on an intermediate balance of random and systematic error in the rating model that suggested a possibility of more prevalent impacts. These results have relevance to management in the Mara basin and to future studies that might establish linkages to historic land use and climatic factors. The concern about uncertain uncertainty intervals (uncertainty2) extends beyond the Mara and is relevant to testing change where non-random rating errors may be important and subtle responses are investigated.

There is a wide variety of techniques to assess discharge uncertainty. However, few studies have developed generalized approaches to quantify discharge uncertainty. This study presents a generalized framework for estimating discharge uncertainty at many gauging stations with different errors in the stage-discharge relationship. The methodology utilizes a nonparametric {LOWESS} regression within a novel framework that accounts for uncertainty in the stagedischarge measurements, scatter in the stage-discharge data and multisection rating curves. The framework was applied to 500 gauging stations in England and Wales and we evaluated the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at low, mean and high ﬂow points on the rating curve. The framework was shown to be robust, versatile and able to capture place-speciﬁc uncertainties for a number of different examples. Our study revealed a wide range of discharge uncertainties (10–397\% discharge uncertainty interval widths), but the majority of the gauging stations (over 80\%) had mean and high ﬂow uncertainty intervals of less than 40\%. We identiﬁed some regional differences in the stage-discharge relationships, however the results show that local conditions dominated in determining the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at a gauging station. This highlights the importance of estimating discharge uncertainty for each gauging station prior to using those data in hydrological analyses.},

First, a summary of the main difficulties encountered in extrapolating rating curves for flood discharge is provided. Then a sensitivity analysis is carried out using a hydraulic modelling approach, applied to eight Mediterranean catchments, and yielding an envelope curve for the stage–discharge relationship, Q(H). To assess the influence of errors in the flood discharge on the uncertainty in estimating extreme floods, a Bayesian framework including a multiplicative error on the rating curve was applied. Its application on two catchments for which historical data are available for the period (1741–2004) shows that ignoring the rating curve errors may lead to an unduly optimistic reduction in the final uncertainty in estimation of flood discharge quantiles. Moreover, the quantile values are also affected by taking into account the rating curve errors.},

This uncertainty stems from two types of error: (a) random errors related to the water-level readings; and (b) systematic errors related to over- or under-estimation of the rating curve. A Bayesian frequency analysis is performed to take both sources of uncertainty into account. It is shown that the uncertainty affecting discharges should be carefully evaluated and taken into account in the flood frequency analysis, as it can increase the quantiles confidence interval.

	abstract = {Maximum flows are often estimated from flood frequency analysis, by means of the statistical fitting of a theoretical probability distribution to maximum annual flow data. However, because of the limitations imposed by the practice of at-site flow measurement, empirical models are applied as the rating curve for estimating streamflow. These curves are approximations of the actual flows and incorporate different sources of uncertainty, especially in the extrapolation portions. These uncertainties are propagated in the frequency analysis and influence the estimated quantiles. For better understanding and describing the influence of the stage-discharge uncertainty in this process, the results of Bayesian rating curve modeling, which considers the physical knowledge of the gauging station as prior information, were combined with Bayesian flood frequency analysis under asymptotic extreme value theory. The method was applied to the Acorizal stream gauging station, located in the interior of the state of Mato Grosso - {BR}. The main results suggested that, although the uncertainties of the rating curve can be relevant in the estimation of maximum flow quantiles, the uncertainties arising from finite-sample inference might exert greater impacts on the flow credibility intervals even for moderate sample sizes.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the joint impact of sample variability and rating curve imprecision in at-site ﬂood frequency analysis. A novel likelihood-based framework is developed for this purpose, assuming a power-law model for the stage-discharge measurements and a generalised extreme value ({GEV}) model for the annual maximum discharges. It is shown that the two models can be pooled into one likelihood function. This allows for simultaneous estimation of the rating curve and {GEV} parameters, and the assessment of the uncertainty of a T-year ﬂood estimate due to both sample variability and rating curve imprecision. Sampling experiments show that (1) the novel method is computationally feasible and little affected by estimation bias, and (2) the chief effect of rating curve imprecision is to inﬂate the estimation variability of the {GEV} quantile estimates. The application of the method to data from 12 Norwegian gauging stations illustrates that (3) the novel and traditional methods give very similar rating curve and {GEV} parameter estimates and (4) the net effect of sample variability and rating curve imprecision can give rise to signiﬁcant wide conﬁdence intervals for the estimated T-year ﬂood.},

The studies concern the period of 60 – 80 years of observation. The trends of riverbed changes during the study period at the selected gauging stations were calculated based on the variability of observed minimal annual water stages. The reasons for the observed changes in the river course and channel geometry are given. These changes were caused by river regulation consisted of the shortening and narrowing of the river channel. Moreover, grain size distribution analysis in the selected gauging stations of Nida River and characteristic diameter variability of sediments along the river course examination are presented. These analyses were to evaluate the variability of characteristic diameters along the river course in connection with observed changes in cross-sections’ geometry. Additionally, to confirm the process of erosion or deposition recognized in the examined river channels, hydrodynamic equilibrium was determined. Three methods were proposed and used: the mean velocity and critical velocity in the main river channel comparison, the stream power value calculation which defines the character of the river channel, and the {WWK} (index of cutting or shallowing of the river channel) index.},

	abstract = {Although discharge estimations are central for water management and hydropower, there are few studies on the variability and uncertainty of their basis; deriving discharge from stage heights through the use of a rating curve that depends on riverbed geometry. A large fraction of the world’s river-discharge stations are presumably located in alluvial channels where riverbed characteristics may change over time because of erosion and sedimentation. This study was conducted to analyse and quantify the dynamic relationship between stage and discharge and to determine to what degree currently used methods are able to account for such variability. The study was carried out for six hydrometric stations in the upper Choluteca River basin, Honduras, where a set of unusually frequent stage–discharge data are available. The temporal variability and the uncertainty of the rating curve and its parameters were analysed through a Monte Carlo ({MC}) analysis on a moving window of data using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation ({GLUE}) methodology. Acceptable ranges for the values of the rating-curve parameters were determined from riverbed surveys at the six stations, and the sampling space was constrained according to those ranges, using three-dimensional alpha shapes. Temporal variability was analysed in three ways: (i) with annually updated rating curves (simulating Honduran practices), (ii) a rating curve for each time window, and (iii) a smoothed, continuous dynamic rating curve derived from the {MC} analysis. The temporal variability of the rating parameters translated into a high rating-curve variability. The variability could turn out as increasing or decreasing trends and/or cyclic behaviour. There was a tendency at all stations to a seasonal variability. The discharge at a given stage could vary by a factor of two or more. The quotient in discharge volumes estimated from dynamic and static rating curves varied between 0.5 and 1.5. The difference between discharge volumes derived from static and dynamic curves was largest for sub-daily ratings but stayed large also for monthly and yearly totals. The relative uncertainty was largest for low ﬂows but it was considerable also for intermediate and large ﬂows. The standard procedure of adjusting rating curves when calculated and observed discharge differ by more than 5\% would have required continuously updated rating curves at the studied locations. We believe that these ﬁndings can be applicable to many other discharge stations around the globe.},

One way of checking the reliability of a climate series is to compare it with surrounding stations. This is the idea behind all tests of the relative homogeneity. Here we will present a simple homogeneity test and apply it to a precipitation data set from south-western Sweden. More precisely we will apply it to ratios between station values and some reference values. The reference value is a form of a mean value from surrounding stations. It is found valuable to include short and incomplete series in the reference value. The test can be used as an instrument for quality control as far as the mean level of, for instance, precipitation is concerned. In practice it should be used along with the available station history. Several non-homogeneities are present in these series and probably reflect a serious source of uncertainty in studies of climatic trends and climatic change all over the world. The significant breaks varied from 5 to 25 per cent for this data set. An example illustrates the importance of using relevant climatic normals that refer to the present measurement conditions in constructing maps of anomalies.},

Presented here are techniques that are suitable in the face of the complications listed above for the exploratory analysis of monthly water quality data for monotonie trends. The first procedure described is a nonparametric test for trend applicable to data sets with seasonality, missing values, or values reported as ‘less than’: the seasonal Kendall test. Under realistic stochastic processes (exhibiting seasonality, skewness, and serial correlation), it is robust in comparison to parametric alternatives, although neither the seasonal Kendall test nor the alternatives can be considered an exact test in the presence of serial correlation. The second procedure, the seasonal Kendall slope estimator, is an estimator of trend magnitude. It is an unbiased estimator of the slope of a linear trend and has considerably higher precision than a regression estimator where data are highly skewed but somewhat lower precision where the data are normal. The third procedure provides a means for testing for change over time in the relationship between constituent concentration and flow, thus avoiding the problem of identifying trends in water quality that are artifacts of the particular sequence of discharges observed (e.g., drought effects). In this method a flow-adjusted concentration is defined as the residual (actual minus conditional expectation) based on a regression of concentration on some function of discharge. These flow-adjusted concentrations, which may also be seasonal and non-normal, can then be tested for trend by using the seasonal Kendall test.},

	abstract = {Les séries temporelles de débit des rivières sont établies à l'aide de "courbes de tarage", qui sont des modèles avec les hauteurs d’eau en entrée et les débits en sortie. Malheureusement, de nombreuses stations hydrométriques ont une relation hauteur-débit instable, notamment à cause de l’évolution du lit de la rivière lors des crues. Ces "détarages" posent problème à la fois pour l'établissement des séries hydrologiques de long-terme (analyse rétrospective) et pour la fourniture de données en temps réel, par exemple pour la prévision des inondations, avec des incertitudes quantifiées et fiables. Les méthodes existantes pour la mise à jour de la courbe de tarage sont basées sur une analyse statistique des données de calibration (jaugeages) passées ou sur des règles empiriques. Cette thèse a permis de développer des méthodes originales pour la détection automatique des détarages et l'estimation de leur amplitude en rétrospectif et en temps réel : une méthode de segmentation des résidus entre les jaugeages et une courbe de référence, une analyse des récessions du limnigramme et une détection de détarages potentiels à partir d'un indicateur disponible en temps réel (par exemple, transport sédimentaire cumulé). L'approche probabiliste permet d'une part de prendre en compte l'incertitude des informations sur les détarages et d'autre part de quantifier les incertitudes sur les débits calculés. La combinaison des trois méthodes a été appliquée à la station de l’Ardèche à Meyras, en France, qui présente des détarages nets après chaque crue importante. Une bonne détection et estimation des détarages a été observée en rétrospectif et en temps réel. La méthode est générale et applicable en opérationnel à d’autres stations après validation. La méthode est générique et, après davantage de validation, applicable en opérationnel à d'autres sites.},

In this work, a model that allows a non-null probability to a regional fixed shape parameter is presented. This methodology is integrated within a Bayesian framework and uses reversible jump techniques. The performance on stochastic data of this new estimator is compared to two other models: a conventional Bayesian analysis and the index flood approach. Results show that the proposed estimator is absolutely suited to regional estimation when only a few data are available at the target site. Moreover, unlike the index flood estimator, target site index flood error estimation seems to have less impact on Bayesian estimators. Some suggestions about configurations of the pooling groups are also presented to increase the performance of each estimator.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern that ﬂooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of ﬂood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on ﬂood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The ﬁrst approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed ﬂood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future ﬂoods. Challenges and opportunities associated with ﬂood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in ﬂood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and ﬂood-rich and ﬂoodpoor periods rather than on short duration ﬂood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed ﬂood changes, by validating scenarios against observed ﬂood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of ﬂood changes and feedbacks. The paper ﬁnishes with a call for a joint European ﬂood change research network.},

The study shows that despite widespread consensus in the scientiﬁc literature on the utility of documentary evidence, the actual migration from academic to practical application has been limited. A detailed review of ﬂood frequency estimation guidelines from diﬀerent countries showed that the value of historical data is generally recognised, but practical methods for systematic and routine inclusion of this type of data into risk analysis are in most cases not available. Studies of historical events were identiﬁed in most countries, and good examples of national databases attempting to collate the available information were identiﬁed. The conclusion is that there is considerable potential for improving the reliability of the current ﬂood risk assessments by harvesting the valuable information on past extreme events contained in the historical data sets.},

A list of historical ﬂood levels from 1644 to the present has been drawn up and converted into discharge using hydraulic modelling. A sensitivity analysis provides error intervals on discharge estimates taking into account uncertainties on water level, roughness coefﬁcient and channel geometry, and the impact of a nonpermanent discharge or the backward effect. A ﬂood frequency analysis using systematic and nonsystematic data gives a practical example on how historical information can improve ﬂood knowledge. It reduces the sampling uncertainty and shows also a good agreement with a hydrometeorological approach (Gradex model).},

The review summaries methods and methodologies applied and key findings from a large number of studies. Reported analyses of observed extreme precipitation and flood records show that there is some evidence of a general increase in extreme precipitation, whereas there are no clear indications of significant trends at large-scale regional or national level of extreme streamflow. Several studies from regions dominated by snowmelt-induced peak flows report decreases in extreme streamflow and earlier spring snowmelt peak flows, likely caused by increasing temperature. The review of likely future changes based on climate projections indicates a general increase in extreme precipitation under a future climate, which is consistent with the observed trends. Hydrological projections of peak flows show large impacts in many areas with both positive and negative changes. A general decrease in flood magnitude and earlier spring floods are projected for catchments with snowmelt-dominated peak flows, which is consistent with the observed trends. Finally, existing guidelines in Europe on design flood and design rainfall estimation are reviewed. The review shows that only few countries have developed guidelines that incorporate a consideration of climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {There now exists clear evidence of the impact of climate change on flooding, creating need for new methodologies for design flood estimation that account for warming induced nonstationarity. Current alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis require the specification of a nonstationary probability model (often with time-varying parameters) that requires sufficient data to be stable. Reliance on the trend in observed data often ignores the dissimilar behaviour of frequent and rare quantiles under a warming climate. This, in turn, results in the direction of change to be consistent across both rare and frequent projected flood quantiles. However, results of multiple recent studies suggest that rarer floods are likely to increase while more frequent floods may decrease in magnitude into the future. In this study, we highlight this limitation of existing nonstationary flood frequency approaches and propose a novel nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis approach that captures the differing behaviour of more frequent and rare flood quantiles under a warming climate. The need for longer flood data to model nonstationarity is accommodated by pooling regional information which makes the projections more precise. Data for 105 Australian catchments are used to validate our proposed approach. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the variation of flood quantiles with varying average recurrence intervals in a changing climate. Finally, a few important statistics of future projections are also presented.},

It ‘borrows strength’ from ‘similar’ basins to improve upon inference at a particular basin. The superpopulation is a key concept in the empirical Bayes approach. It is a probability distribution from which basin parameters are randomly assigned, a conceptualization closely related to regionalization models. It is inferred from observable regional data and expresses the degree of basin ‘similarity’ in a region. This approach treats regionalized estimators as a special case and leads to procedures similar to James-Stein estimators. Empirical Bayes procedures can lead to substantial improvements in performance over site-specific procedures. However, for basins which are very different from the majority, site-specific procedures may perform better. The method of moments approach to inferring the superpopulation is considered in detail.

	abstract = {Statistical distributions of flood peak discharge often show heavy tail behavior, that is, extreme floods are more likely to occur than would be predicted by commonly used distributions that have exponential asymptotic behavior. This heavy tail behavior may surprise flood managers and citizens, as human intuition tends to expect light tail behavior, and the heaviness of the tails is very difficult to predict, which may lead to unnecessarily high flood damage. Despite its high importance, the literature on the heavy tail behavior of flood distributions is rather fragmented. In this review, we provide a coherent overview of the processes causing heavy flood tails and the implications for science and practice. Specifically, we propose nine hypotheses on the mechanisms causing heavy tails in flood peak distributions related to processes in the atmosphere, the catchment, and the river system. We then discuss to which extent the current knowledge supports or contradicts these hypotheses. We also discuss the statistical conditions for the emergence of heavy tail behavior based on derived distribution theory and relate them to the hypotheses and flood generation mechanisms. We review the degree to which the heaviness of the tails can be predicted from process knowledge and data. Finally, we recommend further research toward testing the hypotheses and improving the prediction of heavy tails.},

	abstract = {The application of historical ﬂood information as a tool for augmenting instrumental ﬂood data is increasingly recognised as a valuable tool. Most previous studies have focused on large catchments with historic settlements, this paper applies the approach to the smaller lowland system of the Sussex Ouse in southeast England. The reassessment of ﬂood risk on the Sussex Ouse is pertinent in light of the severe ﬂooding in October 2000 and heightened concerns of a perceived increase in ﬂooding nationally. Systematic ﬂood level readings from 1960 and accounts detailing past ﬂood events within the catchment are compiled back to ca. 1750. This extended ﬂood record provides an opportunity to reassess estimates of ﬂood frequency over a timescale not normally possible within ﬂood frequency analysis. This paper re-evaluates ﬂood frequency at Lewes on the Sussex Ouse downstream of the conﬂuence of the Sussex Ouse and River Uck. The paper considers the strengths and weaknesses in estimates resulting from contrasting methods of analysis and their corresponding data: (i) single site analysis of gauged annual maxima; (ii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude; (iii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude exceeding a known threshold, and (iv) sensitivity analysis including only the very largest historical ﬂood events. Use of the historical information was found to yield much tighter conﬁdence intervals of risk estimates, with uncertainty reduced by up to 40 \% for the 100-year return frequency event when historical information was added to the gauged data.},

The approach is based on standard regionalization methods assuming that the ﬂood peak distribution rescaled by a site-dependent index ﬂood is uniform within a homogeneous region. A likelihood formulation and a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm are used to infer the parameter values of the regional distributions. This statistical inference technique has been selected for its rigorousness – various hypotheses are explicitly formulated in the likelihood function, its ﬂexibility as for the type of data that can be treated, and its ability to compute accurate estimates of the conﬁdence intervals for the adjusted parameters and for the corresponding ﬂood quantiles.},

After identification and collection of data on historical floods, several hydraulic models were constructed to account for geomorphological changes. Recent and historical rating curves were constructed and applied to reconstruct flood discharge series, together with their uncertainty. This uncertainty stems from two types of error: (a) random errors related to the water-level readings; and (b) systematic errors related to over- or under-estimation of the rating curve. A Bayesian frequency analysis is performed to take both sources of uncertainty into account. It is shown that the uncertainty affecting discharges should be carefully evaluated and taken into account in the flood frequency analysis, as it can increase the quantiles confidence interval. The quantiles are found to be consistent with those obtained with empirical methods, for two out of four of the catchments.},

The data set consists of daily runoff series collected from the French Banque Hydro Archive. Streamflow indices were selected in order to describe the evolution of high flows. The trend analysis was carried out applying statistical tests to the time series of the streamflow indices. The idea behind the use of regional tests is that stations located in the same region, that are subject to similar climate, are most likely to behave in the same way to the evolution of climate forcings.},

	abstract = {Climate change has led to concerns about increasing river floods resulting from the greater water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere1. These concerns are reinforced by evidence of increasing economic losses associated with flooding in many parts of the world, including Europe2. Any changes in river floods would have lasting implications for the design of flood protection measures and flood risk zoning. However, existing studies have been unable to identify a consistent continental-scale climatic-change signal in flood discharge observations in Europe3, because of the limited spatial coverage and number of hydrometric stations. Here we demonstrate clear regional patterns of both increases and decreases in observed river flood discharges in the past five decades in Europe, which are manifestations of a changing climate. Our results—arising from the most complete database of European flooding so far—suggest that: increasing autumn and winter rainfall has resulted in increasing floods in northwestern Europe; decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in medium and large catchments in southern Europe; and decreasing snow cover and snowmelt, resulting from warmer temperatures, have led to decreasing floods in eastern Europe. Regional flood discharge trends in Europe range from an increase of about 11 per cent per decade to a decrease of 23 per cent. Notwithstanding the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the observational record, the flood changes identified here are broadly consistent with climate model projections for the next century4,5, suggesting that climate-driven changes are already happening and supporting calls for the consideration of climate change in flood risk management.},

Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate.},

	abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage–discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage–discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage–discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to ‘leaky’ catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets. The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events—the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index ({BFI}) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.

	abstract = {Hydrograph recession constants are required in rainfall-runoff models, baseflow augmentation studies, geohydrologic investigations and in regional low-flow studies. The recession portion of a streamflow hydrograph is shown to be either an autoregressive process or an integrated moving average process, depending upon the structure of the assumed model errors. Six different estimators of the baseflow recession constant are derived and tested using thousands of hydrograph recessions available at twenty-three sites in Massachusetts, U.S. When hydrograph recessions are treated as an autoregressive process, unconditional least squares or maximum likelihood estimators of the baseflow recession constant are shown to exhibit significant downward bias due to the short lengths of hydrograph recessions. The precision of estimated of hydrograph recession constants is shown to depend heavily upon assumptions regarding the structure of the model errors. In general, regression procedures for estimating hydrograph recession parameters are generally preferred to the time-series alternatives. An evaluation of the physical significance of estimates of the baseflow recession constant is provided by comparing regional regression models which relate low-flow statistics to three independent variables: drainage area, basin slope and the baseflow recession constant. As anticipated, approximately unbiased estimators of the baseflow recession constant provide significant information regarding the geohydrologic response of watersheds.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to regional flood frequency analysis is presented and evaluated. The technique is referred to as the region of influence approach in that every site can have a potentially unique set of gauging stations for use in the estimation of at-site extremes. The rationale for the methodology is discussed, and several options for incorporating the approach into regional flood frequency analysis are developed and compared with traditional regional estimation procedures. Through a Monte Carlo experiment, the region of influence approach is demonstrated to provide improved at-site estimates of extreme flow quantlies in terms of network average root mean squared error and comparable results for bias. The method is further shown to have attractive features for estimating extremes for unusual sites in a network of gauging stations.},

	abstract = {In this article, an approach using Bayesian Generalised Least Squares ({BGLS}) regression in a region-of-influence ({ROI}) framework is proposed for regional flood frequency analysis ({RFFA}) for ungauged catchments. Using the data from 399 catchments in eastern Australia, the {BGLS}-{ROI} is constructed to regionalise the flood quantiles (Quantile Regression Technique ({QRT})) and the first three moments of the log-Pearson type 3 ({LP}3) distribution (Parameter Regression Technique ({PRT})). This scheme firstly develops a fixed region model to select the best set of predictor variables for use in the subsequent regression analyses using an approach that minimises the model error variance while also satisfying a number of statistical selection criteria. The identified optimal regression equation is then used in the {ROI} experiment where the {ROI} is chosen for a site in question as the region that minimises the predictive uncertainty. To evaluate the overall performances of the quantiles estimated by the {QRT} and {PRT}, a one-at-a-time cross-validation procedure is applied. Results of the proposed method indicate that both the {QRT} and {PRT} in a {BGLS}-{ROI} framework lead to more accurate and reliable estimates of flood quantiles and moments of the {LP}3 distribution when compared to a fixed region approach. Also the {BGLS}-{ROI} can deal reasonably well with the heterogeneity in Australian catchments as evidenced by the regression diagnostics. Based on the evaluation statistics it was found that both {BGLS}-{QRT} and {PRT}-{ROI} perform similarly well, which suggests that the {PRT} is a viable alternative to {QRT} in {RFFA}. The {RFFA} methods developed in this paper is based on the database available in eastern Australia. It is expected that availability of a more comprehensive database (in terms of both quality and quantity) will further improve the predictive performance of both the fixed and {ROI} based {RFFA} methods presented in this study, which however needs to be investigated in future when such a database is available.},

	abstract = {Regression-based methods are widely used in flood regionalization. Since the generalized least squares ({GLS}) regression model properly accounts for both model and sampling errors, realistic estimates of uncertainty can be obtained. This study presents a general Bayesian approach for inferring the {GLS} regional regression model and for combining with any available site information to obtain the most accurate flood quantiles. A robust block Metropolis scheme is developed to sample the posterior distribution of the {GLS} regression model parameters. A particular feature of the sampler is the use of a uniform proposal for the regional model error variance to avoid convergence difficulties. A simple but general procedure, based on importance sampling, is developed to combine any kind of site information with regional information. The benefit of this approach is that all available information is fully exploited, and uncertainty is rigorously quantified as well as being minimized. Two case studies are presented. A synthetic case study illustrates the complex nature of the posterior distribution for the regional model error variance with its shape dependent on how much sampling error dominates the total error in the regional {GLS} model. A second case study involving 24 sites from the east coast of Australia is presented for the log Pearson {III} model. It demonstrates the significant benefit of combining site and regional information and the quantification of uncertainty.},

This paper presents a clear theoretical framework for the use of canonical correlations in regional flood frequency analysis. Some additional results are also presented for the case of gauged target-basins. The approach described in this paper allows one to carry out the determination of homogeneous hydrologic neighborhoods and identifies the variables to use during the step of regional estimation. A data set of 106 stations from the province of Ontario (Canada) is used to demonstrate the advantages of this method and investigate various aspects in relation with its robustness. Results indicate that the method is robust to such factors as the number of stations and the type of parametric distribution being used.

This has attracted the attention of national and international agencies, research institutions, academia, and practicing water specialists, which has led to developing new techniques that may be useful in those cases where there is good evidence and attribution of nonstationarity.

	abstract = {The application of historical ﬂood information as a tool for augmenting instrumental ﬂood data is increasingly recognised as a valuable tool. Most previous studies have focused on large catchments with historic settlements, this paper applies the approach to the smaller lowland system of the Sussex Ouse in southeast England. The reassessment of ﬂood risk on the Sussex Ouse is pertinent in light of the severe ﬂooding in October 2000 and heightened concerns of a perceived increase in ﬂooding nationally. Systematic ﬂood level readings from 1960 and accounts detailing past ﬂood events within the catchment are compiled back to ca. 1750. This extended ﬂood record provides an opportunity to reassess estimates of ﬂood frequency over a timescale not normally possible within ﬂood frequency analysis. This paper re-evaluates ﬂood frequency at Lewes on the Sussex Ouse downstream of the conﬂuence of the Sussex Ouse and River Uck. The paper considers the strengths and weaknesses in estimates resulting from contrasting methods of analysis and their corresponding data: (i) single site analysis of gauged annual maxima; (ii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude; (iii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude exceeding a known threshold, and (iv) sensitivity analysis including only the very largest historical ﬂood events. Use of the historical information was found to yield much tighter conﬁdence intervals of risk estimates, with uncertainty reduced by up to 40 \% for the 100-year return frequency event when historical information was added to the gauged data.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Historical records are an important source of information on extreme and rare floods and fundamental to establish a reliable flood return frequency. The use of long historical records for flood frequency analysis brings in the question of flood stationarity, since climatic and land-use conditions can affect the relevance of past flooding as a predictor of future flooding. In this paper, a detailed 400 yr flood record from the Tagus River in Aranjuez (central Spain) was analysed under stationary and non-stationary flood frequency approaches, to assess their contribution within hazard studies. Historical flood records in Aranjuez were obtained from documents (Proceedings of the City Council, diaries, chronicles, memoirs, etc.), epigraphic marks, and indirect historical sources and reports. The water levels associated with different floods (derived from descriptions or epigraphic marks) were computed into discharge values using a one-dimensional hydraulic model. Secular variations in flood magnitude and frequency, found to respond to climate and environmental drivers, showed a good correlation between high values of historical flood discharges and a negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) index. Over the systematic gauge record (1913–2008), an abrupt change on flood magnitude was produced in 1957 due to constructions of three major reservoirs in the Tagus headwaters (Bolarque, Entrepeñas and Buendia) controlling 80\% of the watershed surface draining to Aranjuez. Two different models were used for the flood frequency analysis: (a) a stationary model estimating statistical distributions incorporating imprecise and categorical data based on maximum likelihood estimators, and (b) a time-varying model based on "generalized additive models for location, scale and shape" ({GAMLSS}) modelling, which incorporates external covariates related to climate variability ({NAO} index) and catchment hydrology factors (in this paper a reservoir index; {RI}). Flood frequency analysis using documentary data (plus gauged records) improved the estimates of the probabilities of rare floods (return intervals of 100 yr and higher). Under non-stationary modelling flood occurrence associated with an exceedance probability of 0.01 (i.e. return period of 100 yr) has changed over the last 500 yr due to decadal and multi-decadal variability of the {NAO}. Yet, frequency analysis under stationary models was successful in providing an average discharge around which value flood quantiles estimated by non-stationary models fluctuate through time.},

In historical ﬂoods reconstruction, due to the lower precision of input data, the magnitude of this uncertainty could reach a high value. With the objectives of giving an estimate of the peak ﬂow error of a typical historical ﬂood reconstruction with the model {HEC}-{RAS} and of providing a quick, simple uncertainty assessment that an end user could easily apply, the uncertainty of the reconstructed peak ﬂow of a major ﬂood in the Ebro River ({NE} Iberian Peninsula) was calculated with a set of local sensitivity analyses on six input variables. The peak ﬂow total error was estimated at ±31\% and water height was found to be the most inﬂuential variable on peak ﬂow, followed by Manning’s n. However, the latter, due to its large uncertainty, was the greatest contributor to peak ﬂow total error. Besides, the {HEC}-{RAS} resulting peak ﬂow was compared to the ones obtained with the 2D model Iber and with Manning’s equation; all three methods gave similar peak ﬂows. Manning’s equation gave almost the same result than {HEC}-{RAS}. The main conclusion is that, to ensure the lowest peak ﬂow error, the reliability and precision of the ﬂood mark should be thoroughly assessed.},

Palaeoflood modelling research has largely focused on one-dimensional analysis for geomorphologically stable fluvial settings because two-dimensional analysis for dynamic alluvial settings is time consuming and requires a detailed representation of the past landscape. In this study, we make the step to spatially continuous palaeoflood modelling for a large and dynamic lowland area. We applied advanced hydraulic model simulations (1D–2D coupled set-up in {HEC}-{RAS} with 950 channel sections and 108 × 103 floodplain grid cells) to quantify the extent and magnitude of past floods in the Lower Rhine river valley and upper delta. As input, we used a high-resolution terrain reconstruction (palaeo-{DEM}) of the area in early mediaeval times, complemented with hydraulic roughness values. After conducting a series of model runs with increasing discharge magnitudes at the upstream boundary, we compared the simulated flood water levels with an inventory of exceeded and non-exceeded elevations extracted from various geological, archaeological and historical sources. This comparison demonstrated a Lower Rhine millennial flood magnitude of approximately 14,000 m3/s for the Late Holocene period before late mediaeval times. This value exceeds the largest measured discharges in the instrumental record, but not the design discharges currently accounted for in flood risk management.},

Two categories of historical information are considered: “censored” data, where the magnitudes of historical flood peaks are known; and “binomial” data, where only threshold exceedance information is available. A Monte Carlo study employing the two-parameter lognormal distribution shows that maximum likelihood estimators ({MLEs}) can extract the equivalent of an additional 10–30 years of gage record from a 50-year period of historical observation. The {MLE} routines are shown to be substantially better than an adjusted-moment estimator similar to the one recommended in Bulletin 17B of the United States Water Resources Council Hydrology Committee (1982). The {MLE} methods performed well even when floods were drawn from other than the assumed lognormal distribution.},

Bayesian flood frequency analyses with annual peak discharge, historical, and paleohydrologic bound data for the Santa Ynez River, California, and the Big Lost River, Idaho, demonstrate that paleohydrologic bounds reduce quantile biases by placing large observed peak discharges in their proper long-term contexts and substantially narrow peak discharge confidence intervals when estimating floods with low exceedance probabilities.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a Bayesian statistical model for estimating ﬂood frequency by combining uncertain annual maximum ({AMAX}) data from a river gauge with estimates of ﬂood peak discharge from various historic sources that predate the period of instrument records. Such historic ﬂood records promise to expand the time series data needed for reducing the uncertainty in return period estimates for extreme events, but the heterogeneity and uncertainty of historic records make them difﬁcult to use alongside Flood Estimation Handbook and other standard methods for generating ﬂood frequency curves from gauge data. Using the ﬂow of the River Eden in Carlisle, Cumbria, {UK} as a case study, this paper develops a Bayesian model for combining historic ﬂood estimates since 1800 with gauge data since 1967 to estimate the probability of low frequency ﬂood events for the area taking account of uncertainty in the discharge estimates. Results show a reduction in 95\% conﬁdence intervals of roughly 50\% for annual exceedance probabilities of less than 0.0133 (return periods over 75 years) compared to standard ﬂood frequency estimation methods using solely systematic data. Sensitivity analysis shows the model is sensitive to 2 model parameters both of which are concerned with the historic (pre-systematic) period of the time series. This highlights the importance of adequate consideration of historic channel and ﬂoodplain changes or possible bias in estimates of historic ﬂood discharges. The next steps required to roll out this Bayesian approach for operational ﬂood frequency estimation at other sites is also discussed. Ó 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The paper describes a simple method of incorporating such data into probability analyses and illustrates it by application to the probability analysis of ice breakup stages on the Peace River at Fort Vermilion, Alberta, Canada. There is generally little standard hydrometric information on such water levels, yet they are often a very significant component of the annual maximum water levels in cold regions. In such situations the analysis of historical data is particularly important.},

	abstract = {Flood disaster mitigation strategies should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the flood risk combined with a thorough investigation of the uncertainties associated with the risk assessment procedure. Within the "German Research Network of Natural Disasters" ({DFNK}) the working group "Flood Risk Analysis" investigated the flood process chain from precipitation, runoff generation and concentration in the catchment, flood routing in the river network, possible failure of flood protection measures, inundation to economic damage. The working group represented each of these processes by deterministic, spatially distributed models at different scales. While these models provide the necessary understanding of the flood process chain, they are not suitable for risk and uncertainty analyses due to their complex nature and high {CPU}-time demand. We have therefore developed a stochastic flood risk model consisting of simplified model components associated with the components of the process chain. We parameterised these model components based on the results of the complex deterministic models and used them for the risk and uncertainty analysis in a Monte Carlo framework. The Monte Carlo framework is hierarchically structured in two layers representing two different sources of uncertainty, aleatory uncertainty (due to natural and anthropogenic variability) and epistemic uncertainty (due to incomplete knowledge of the system). The model allows us to calculate probabilities of occurrence for events of different magnitudes along with the expected economic damage in a target area in the first layer of the Monte Carlo framework, i.e. to assess the economic risks, and to derive uncertainty bounds associated with these risks in the second layer. It is also possible to identify the contributions of individual sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty. It could be shown that the uncertainty caused by epistemic sources significantly alters the results obtained with aleatory uncertainty alone. The model was applied to reaches of the river Rhine downstream of Cologne.},

One would expect that an estimate of the historical maximum event; i.e., the maximum flood in a period of perhaps 100–200 years, would, if properly included in the estimation procedure, improve the resulting estimate of the flood magnitude at the given return period. We attempt to assess the value of historical information using computer simulation. An annual flood sequence and a historical maximum event are generated from ah extreme-value distribution (of type I or {II}) and quantitiles of the distribution are estimated by maximum likelihood, both including the excluding the historical event. After many such simulations have been performed the accuracy of the quantile estimates is assessed. We also consider the effect of errors in the magnitude of historical discharge estimates and the use of historical data in regional flood frequency analysis.},

In the United Kingdom, the Flood Estimation Handbook ({FEH}) methodologies are used by practitioners to estimate flood flows. Until recently it was challenging for practitioners to include additional non-continuous flood information, such as historical flood descriptions from historical archives, in their analyses, to reduce the uncertainty within the {FEH} approaches. This paper shows how Bayesian statistical methods can be applied to historical data which have degrees of uncertainty associated with then to improve design flood flows. The paper uses the River Avon at Evesham in the United Kingdom as a case study to illustrate the advantages of the method. The inclusion of historical information at this site improves the estimates of the one in 100 year flood flow compared to the values generated by the {FEH} pooling group method. The paper makes recommendations as to how practitioners could be encouraged to use historical flood water levels in their analysis of floods more regularly.},

	abstract = {After an introduction to the traditional flood frequency analysis methods, this article discusses their limits and the risks associated with their thoughtless use: overconfidence in the estimated values of flood quantiles or return periods and systematic underestimation of risks. The article then presents and illustrates the added value of modern Bayesian flood frequency inference procedures that are statistically consistent, numerically accurate, and now computationally affordable. The implementation of such methods shows that estimated flood frequencies, based on observed samples of limited size, are generally affected by large uncertainties. This acknowledgement should be an incentive for increasing the size of the analyzed samples through a more systematic use of historic information as well as regional approaches in flood frequency analyses. It also clearly points out that the margin of errors should be considered when using inference results for design or risk assessment purposes. Several pieces of software are now available to conduct Bayesian flood frequency analyses relatively straightforwardly. There is no remaining obstacle to the implementation of these modern approaches in operational hydrological studies.

The study shows that despite widespread consensus in the scientific literature on the utility of documentary evidence, the actual migration from academic to practical application has been limited. A detailed review of flood frequency estimation guidelines from different countries showed that the value of historical data is generally recognised, but practical methods for systematic and routine inclusion of this type of data into risk analysis are in most cases not available. Studies of historical events were identified in most countries, and good examples of national databases attempting to collate the available information were identified. The conclusion is that there is considerable potential for improving the reliability of the current flood risk assessments by harvesting the valuable information on past extreme events contained in the historical data sets.},

	abstract = {The existing attitude that the criterion for choice of plotting position is arbitrary is rebuked and it is shown that a worthwhile criterion can be based on desired statistical properties of the plot, rather than on comparison of plotting positions with estimates of probability for individual sample values. These properties are that any quantile estimate made from the plot should be unbiased and should have smallest mean square error among all such estimates. This leads to specification of plotting position initially in terms of reduced variate rather than probability value. The unbiased plotting position is E(y(i)), the mean of the ith order statistic in samples from the reduced variate population, which differs from one distribution to another. A good approximation for each distribution is available in the probability domain. These take the general form (i − α)(N + 1 − 2α) with α = 38 in the normal case and α = 0.44 in the extreme-value type-1 ({EV}1) and exponential cases. The Weibull formula, α = 0, is correct for the uniform distribution alone and is shown to be biased for other distributions. Hazen's formula α = 12 shows up much better in terms of bias than many would expect. If a single simple distribution free formula were required then α = 25 would be the best compromise. The plotting position postulates which have supported the Weibull formula for many years are examined and some are seen to be unreasonable in view of statistical facts.},

	abstract = {Flood frequency analyses are often based on recorded series at gauging stations. However, the length of the available data sets is usually too short to provide reliable estimates of extreme design ﬂoods. Hence, hydrologists have tried to make use of alternative sources of information to enrich the datasets used for the statistical inferences. Two main approaches were therefore proposed. The ﬁrst consists in extending the information in time, making use of historical and paleoﬂood data. The second, spatial extension, consists in merging statistically homogeneous data to build large regional data samples. Recently, a combination of the two techniques aiming at including estimated extreme discharges at ungauged sites of a region in the regional ﬂood frequency analyses has been proposed. This paper presents a consolidation of this approach and its comparison with the standard regional ﬂood frequency approach proposed by Hosking \& Wallis. A modiﬁcation of the likelihood function is introduced to enable the simultaneous calibration of a regional index ﬂood relation and of the parameters of the regional growth curve. Moreover, the efﬁciency of the proposed method is evaluated based on a large number of Monte Carlo simulated data sets. This work conﬁrms that extreme peak discharges estimated at ungauged sites may be of great value for the evaluation of large return period (typically over 100 years) ﬂood quantiles. They should therefore not be neglected despite the uncertainties associated to these estimates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Glomma river is the largest in Norway with a catchment area of 154 450 km2. People living near the shores of this river are frequently exposed to destructive floods that impair local cities and communities. Unfortunately, design flood predictions are hampered by uncertainty since the standard flood records are much shorter than the requested return period and also the climate is expected to change in the coming decades. Here we combine systematic- historical and paleo-information in an effort to improve flood frequency analysis and better understand potential linkages to both climate and non-climatic forcing. Specifically, we (i) compile historical flood data from the existing literature, (ii) produce high resolution X-ray fluorescence ({XRF}), Magnetic Susceptibility ({MS}) and Computed Tomography ({CT}) scanning data from a sediment core covering the last 10 300 years, and (iii) integrate these data sets in order to better estimate design floods and assess non-stationarities. Based on observations from Lake Flyginnsjøen, receiving sediments from Glomma only when it reaches a certain threshold, we can estimate flood frequency in a moving window of 50 years across millennia revealing that past flood frequency is non-stationary on different time scales. We observe that periods with increased flood activity (4000–2000 years ago and},

Lead-210, caesium-137, and geochemical analysis of mining-contaminated slackwater ﬂood sediments have been used to reconstruct the history of these ﬂood deposits. These age controls were combined with the continuous record of Gardon ﬂow since 1890, and the combined records were then used to assign ages to slackwater deposits. The stratigraphic records of terrace {GE} and cave {GG} were excellent examples to illustrate the effects of erosion/preservation in a context of a progressively self-censoring, vertically accreting sequence. The sedimentary ﬂood record of the terrace {GE} located at 10 m above the channel bed is complete for years post-1958 but incomplete before. During the 78-year period 1880–1958, 25 ﬂoods of a sufﬁcient magnitude (N 1450 m3/s) have covered the terrace. Since 1958, however, the frequency of inundation of the deposits has been lower: only 5 or 6 ﬂoods in 52 years have been large enough to exceed the necessary threshold discharge (N1700 m3/s). The progressive increase of the threshold discharge and the reduced frequency of inundation at the terrace could allow stabilization of the vegetation cover and improve protection against erosion from subsequent large magnitude ﬂood events. The sedimentary ﬂood record seems complete for cave {GG} located at 15 m above the channel bed. Here, the low frequency of events would have enabled a high degree of stabilization of the sedimentary ﬂood record, rendering the deposits less susceptible to erosion.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment for climate-sensitive systems often relies on the analysis of several variables measured at many sites. In probabilistic terms, the task is to model the joint distribution of several spatially distributed variables, and how it varies in time. This paper describes a Bayesian hierarchical framework for this purpose. Each variable follows a distribution with parameters varying in both space and time. Temporal variability is modeled by means of hidden climate indices ({HCIs}) that are extracted from observed variables. This is to be contrasted with the usual approach using predefined standard climate indices ({SCIs}) for this purpose. In the second level of the model, the {HCIs} and their effects are assumed to follow temporal and spatial Gaussian processes, respectively. Both intervariable and intersite dependencies are induced by the strong effect of common {HCIs}. The flexibility of the framework is illustrated with a case study in Southeast Australia aimed at modeling “hot-and-dry” summer conditions. It involves three physical variables (streamflow, precipitation, and temperature) measured on three distinct station networks, with varying data availability and representing hundreds of sites in total. The {HCI} model delivers reliable and sharp time-varying distributions for individual variables and sites. In addition, it adequately reproduces intervariable and intersite dependencies, whereas a corresponding {SCI} model (where hidden climate indices are replaced with standard ones) strongly underestimates them. It is finally suggested that {HCI} models may be used as downscaling tools to estimate the joint distribution of several variables at many stations from climate models or reanalyzes.},
