	abstract = {From the {HISTRHONE} database we extracted 1483 hydro-meteorological events from {AD} 1300 to 2000 that occurred in the Lower Rhône Valley, France. Daily heights of the Rhône River at Beaucaire and Arles are also available, from 1816 and 1829, respectively. A total of 517 floods were divided into three categories and a synthetic frequency severity index ({FSI}) was computed. Running averages of 11 and 31 years show a succession of poor and rich flood fluctuations. Extreme floods tripled in the second half of the period (1650–2000). Singular spectrum analysis isolates a dominant irregular component (main positive anomalies in 1450–1580, around 1700, late 18th century, and most of the 20th century). We focus on the 17th century, with rare flooding events between two secular so-called “hyper phases”, i.e. frequent and/or severe floods. We also recorded 173 episodes of ice in the river, during the Little Ice Age.},

The study of the annual, monthly and decennial distribution of this crues allows the correlation between the frequency of the river's frost and the frequency of the crues over 4 meters. The Little Ice Age ({XVIth} {XIXth} centuries) coincide with a frequency of the floods never reached in the twentieth century, with some very critical stages (Late sixteenth century, 1701- 1710, and 1811-1820). A high ratio of the spring and summer in the height of the long and colder stages has also been noted , which is another explanation for the high proportion of recurrent floods that have been noticed.},

Our studies explore a large collection of historical archives in hydrology and hydrometry, found by a historian. This watershed is characterised by an incredible density of hydrological stations, with more than 150 stations and 4500 years of hydrological records, since the beginning of the 20th century. As an example, the archives of 10 stations starting between 1900 and 1917 were very detailed, with all the gaugings, rating curves, and streamflows records. Archives also reveal the great scientific and technical involvement at that period to understand, develop streamflow measurements and estimate available water resources. Then, we present an estimation of streamflow uncertainty of historical series due to the height measurement strategy. Results show that long streamflow series are not homogeneous in time and that old streamflows series could be significantly biased during snowmelt. Finally, this paper shows the great interest of historical time‑series to better characterise hydrometeorological variability.},

	abstract = {Annual maximum ﬂood ({AMF}) sampling remains the most popular approach to ﬂood frequency analysis. An alternative, the “peaks over threshold” ({POT}) approach, deals with the selection of over-threshold values. However, the {POT} approach remains under-employed mainly because of the complexities associated with its use. Among the difﬁculties are the choice of threshold and the selection of criteria for retaining ﬂood peaks. The literature remains sparse and incoherent concerning the various elements and complexities of the {POT} model. The purpose of the present paper is to shed some light on some of the recurrent and most important questions with regard to the practice of {POT} modeling, and to make a ﬁrst step in establishing a set of coherent practice-oriented guidelines for the use of the {POT} model. This paper reviews tests and methods useful for modeling the process of over-threshold values, the choice of the threshold level, the veriﬁcation of the independence of the values and the stationarity of the process, and also presents an application. ᭧ 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {The stage-discharge rating curve is subject at many hydrometric stations to sudden changes (shifts) typically caused by morphogenic floods. We propose an original method for estimating shift times using the stage-discharge observations, also known as gaugings. This method is based on a recursive segmentation procedure that accounts for both gaugings and rating curve uncertainties through a Bayesian framework. It starts with the estimation of a baseline rating curve using all available gaugings. Then it computes the residuals between the gaugings and this rating curve with uncertainties. It proceeds with the segmentation of the time series of residuals through a multi-change point Bayesian estimation accounting for residuals uncertainties. Once the first set of shift times is identified, the same procedure is recursively applied to each sub-period through a “top-down” approach searching for all effective shifts. The proposed method is illustrated using the Ardèche River at Meyras in France (a typical hydrometric site subject to river bed degradation) and evaluated using several synthetic data sets for which the true shift times are known. The applications confirm the added value of the recursive segmentation compared with a “single-pass” approach and highlight the importance of properly accounting for uncertainties in the segmented data. The recursive procedure effectively disentangles rating changes from observational and rating curve uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Discharge time series in rivers and streams are usually based on simple stage-discharge relations calibrated using a set of direct stage-discharge measurements called gaugings. Bayesian inference recently emerged as a most promising framework to build such hydrometric rating curves accurately and to estimate the associated uncertainty. In addition to providing the rigorous statistical framework necessary to uncertainty analysis, the main advantage of the Bayesian analysis of rating curves arises from the quantitative assessment of (i) the hydraulic controls that govern the stage-discharge relation, and of (ii) the individual uncertainties of available gaugings, which often diﬀer according to the discharge measurement procedure and the ﬂow conditions. In this paper, we introduce the {BaRatin} method for the Bayesian analysis of stationary rating curves and we apply it to three typical cases of hydrometric stations with contrasted ﬂow conditions and variable abundance of hydraulic knowledge and gauging data. The results exemplify that the thorough analysis of hydraulic controls and the quantiﬁcation of gauging uncertainties are required to obtain reliable and physically sound results.},

	abstract = {Establishing streamflow time series in unstable rivers is challenged by changes in the stage-discharge relation after floods. Then, the field hydrologist must develop a new stage-discharge rating curve using new calibration data but also using some information from previous calibration data and previous rating curves. The process includes a large amount of informal expert knowledge and hydraulic assumptions seldom made explicit. This paper develops a stage-period-discharge ({SPD}) model based on the physical interpretation of changes in the stage-discharge relation across a series of stability periods defined by known dates and times. Using simple hydraulic equations, the user provides prior knowledge on the controls, their static and varying parameters, and their possible changes. As a single model is used for all the periods, the estimation of all rating curves can be performed in one go: All gaugings hence provide information to estimate the static parameters and the varying parameters for the relevant periods. Bayesian inference is used, providing a natural way to include prior knowledge and to quantify uncertainty. The generality and some key properties of the method are demonstrated through application to two hydrometric stations, differing in hydraulic configuration and in number and type of changes. Specific experiments demonstrate the ability of the {SPD} model to transfer information across periods. Consequently, rating curves are more precisely estimated than by separately estimating them for each period. The {SPD} model provides a hydraulically based, transparent, and user-friendly approach to replace manual shift corrections traditionally applied in operational practice, with a quantification of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Stage measurement errors are generally overlooked when streamﬂow time series are derived from uncertain rating curves. We introduce an original method for propagating stage uncertainties due to two types of stage measurement errors: (i) errors of the stage read during the gauging and (ii) systematic and nonsystematic (independent) errors of the recorded stage time series. The error models are generic and can be used for any probabilistic rating curve estimation method that provides an ensemble of rating curves. The new method is applied to a range of six contrasting hydrometric stations in France. Uncertainty budgets quantifying the contribution of various error sources to the total streamﬂow uncertainty are computed and compared for streamﬂow time series averaged at time intervals from hour to year. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the stage time series error model to identify the most sensitive parameters. The results are site speciﬁc, which illustrates the key role played by the properties of both the hydrometric site and the gauged catchment. Across the range of sites, stage errors of the gaugings are found to have limited impact on rating curve uncertainty, at least for gaugings performed in fair conditions. Nonsystematic errors in the stage time series have a negligible effect, generally. However, systematic stage errors should not be neglected. Over the six hydrometric stations in this study, the 95\% uncertainty component reﬂecting stage systematic errors (from 60.5 cm to 66.8 cm) alone ranged from 4\% to 12\% of daily average streamﬂow, and from 1\% to 3\% of yearly average streamﬂow as sensors were assumed to be recalibrated every 30 days. Perspectives for improving and validating the streamﬂow uncertainty estimation techniques are eventually discussed.},

The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

We ﬁnd that sample uncertainty is the main contributor to the design ﬂood estimation uncertainty. However, under extrapolation of the rating curve, the uncertainty bounds for both the rating curve model and the ﬂood frequency analysis are highly skewed and ignoring these features may underestimate the potential risk of ﬂooding. We expect this effect to be even more pronounced in arid and semiarid climates with a higher variability in ﬂoods.},

The analysis is performed with wave-height data recorded off the Spanish Catalan coast ({NW} Mediterranean) and wave-height data from the Dutch coast (North Sea). An analysis with natural-scale and log-transformed wave-height time series has been performed. This scale selection is proven to be advantageous for naturally bounded variables and also better captures some distribution features. The paper ends with a discussion on how the different techniques can be used to select a statistically robust threshold for an extreme event deﬁnition.

However, when the local data series is short, frequency analysis results become unreliable. Regional frequency analysis is a convenient way to reduce the estimation uncertainty. In this work, we propose a regional Bayesian model for short record length sites. This model is less restrictive than the Index Flood model while preserving the formalism of “homogeneous regions”. Performance of the proposed model is assessed on a set of gauging stations in France. The accuracy of quantile estimates as a function of homogeneousness level of the pooling group is also analysed. Results indicate that the regional Bayesian model outperforms the Index Flood model and local estimators. Furthermore, it seems that working with relatively large and homogeneous regions may lead to more accurate results than working with smaller and highly homogeneous regions.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1029/ 2018WR022708},
	abstract = {Streamﬂow time series are commonly derived from stage-discharge rating curves, but the uncertainty of the rating curve and resulting streamﬂow series are poorly understood. While different methods to quantify uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship exist, there is limited understanding of how uncertainty estimates differ between methods due to different assumptions and methodological choices. We compared uncertainty estimates and stage-discharge rating curves from seven methods at three river locations of varying hydraulic complexity. Comparison of the estimated uncertainties revealed a wide range of estimates, particularly for high and low ﬂows. At the simplest site on the Isère River (France), full width 95\% uncertainties for the different methods ranged from 3 to 17\% for median ﬂows. In contrast, uncertainties were much higher and ranged from 41 to 200\% for high ﬂows in an extrapolated section of the rating curve at the Mahurangi River (New Zealand) and 28 to 101\% for low ﬂows at the Taf River (United Kingdom), where the hydraulic control is unstable at low ﬂows. Differences between methods result from differences in the sources of uncertainty considered, differences in the handling of the time-varying nature of rating curves, differences in the extent of hydraulic knowledge assumed, and differences in assumptions when extrapolating rating curves above or below the observed gaugings. Ultimately, the selection of an uncertainty method requires a match between user requirements and the assumptions made by the uncertainty method. Given the signiﬁcant differences in uncertainty estimates between methods, we suggest that a clear statement of uncertainty assumptions be presented alongside streamﬂow uncertainty estimates. Plain Language Summary Knowledge of the uncertainty in streamﬂow discharge measured at gauging stations is important for water management applications and scientiﬁc analysis. This paper shows that uncertainty estimates vary widely (typically up to a factor of 4) when comparing seven recently introduced estimation methods. A clear understanding of the assumptions underpinning different uncertainty estimation methods and the sources of uncertainty included in their calculations is needed when selecting a method and using and presenting its uncertainty estimates.},

	abstract = {This review and commentary sets out the need for authoritative and concise information on the expected error distributions and magnitudes in observational data. We discuss the necessary components of a benchmark of dominant data uncertainties and the recent developments in hydrology which increase the need for such guidance. We initiate the creation of a catalogue of accessible information on characteristics of data uncertainty for the key hydrological variables of rainfall, river discharge and water quality (suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen). This includes demonstration of how uncertainties can be quantiﬁed, summarizing current knowledge and the standard quantitative results available. In particular, synthesis of results from multiple studies allows conclusions to be drawn on factors which control the magnitude of data uncertainty and hence improves provision of prior guidance on those uncertainties. Rainfall uncertainties were found to be driven by spatial scale, whereas river discharge uncertainty was dominated by ﬂow condition and gauging method. Water quality variables presented a more complex picture with many component errors. For all variables, it was easy to ﬁnd examples where relative error magnitudes exceeded 40\%. We consider how data uncertainties impact on the interpretation of catchment dynamics, model regionalization and model evaluation. In closing the review, we make recommendations for future research priorities in quantifying data uncertainty and highlight the need for an improved ‘culture of engagement’ with observational uncertainties.

Basic assumptions about the nature of this uncertainty are necessary in every analysis of hydrometric data, and an understanding of the variability of uncertainty can facilitate the effective use of hydrologic information. For most of the twentieth century there has been little change in hydrometric methods and many analysts explicitly or implicitly assume that the uncertainty has not changed over the period of record. We argue that there is substantial variability in the magnitude of uncertainty in published streamflow records that is not transparent to data users. Quantifying uncertainty is particularly important in the context of the current changes in hydrometric technology and in the increasing integration of data sets from multiple providers. We recommend best practices for identifying uncertainty in field notes and propagating that observational uncertainty through the data production process. We suggest both field and reanalysis studies that could be undertaken to improve understanding of hydrometric uncertainty. We also recommend improvements in management practices, including preservation of relevant metadata and a suitable period of overlap for new and old observing systems to allow assessment of the effects of changing technology.},

The present work discusses the impact of inaccurate head measurement on observed instantaneous ﬂood discharge. The sources and sizes of uncertainties in head determination are discussed. A simple uncertainty model is developed in order to quantify the uncertainty in error-corrupted instantaneous and mean discharge. It is shown that uncertainty in mean discharge is less affected by uncorrelated head measurement error, while instantaneous discharges are substantially affected. Practical modelling using data from a Norwegian urban gauging station is undertaken. It is shown that the estimated annual maximum instantaneous ﬂood discharge from this watershed has 95\% conﬁdence limits with sizes of 17 – 19\% of the estimated discharge for average head measurement accuracy. Furthermore, it is shown that variability in head determination causes only a minor potential for bias in estimated instantaneous ﬂood population statistics and quantiles.},

We use a hydraulic model to normalize historic ﬂood events for anthropogenic and natural changes in the river system. As a result, the data set of measured discharges could be extended by approximately 600 years. The study shows that historic ﬂood events decrease the conﬁdence interval of the ﬂood frequency curve signiﬁcantly, speciﬁcally in the range of large ﬂoods.

Direct computation methods are suggested for estimating the uncertainty components related to the vertical integration of velocity and to the transversal integration of velocity and depth. Discharge extrapolations to the edges and in the top/bottom layers are explicitly taken into account, as well as the distribution of the verticals throughout the cross-section. The new uncertainty analysis method was applied to streamgauging data which are representative of varied site conditions and field procedures.

Estimating the uncertainty of discharge measurements is necessary to make consistent decisions. Although discharge measurement techniques have improved in recent decades, uncertainty analysis remains a challenge in hydrometry due to the lack of discharge standards in the field. This study aims at estimating the uncertainty of velocity‑area discharge measurements with potential perspective of updating the {ISO} 748 standard. To address the limitations of existing methods, this study presents a new analytical propagation method, called Flaure, to estimate the uncertainty components. Special attention is paid to the estimation of the dominant u’m component related to cross‑sectional interpolation errors of velocities and depths. High‑resolution reference gaugings are used to assess the uncertainty component through a statistical analysis. The method then establishes an explicit link between the estimation of cross‑sectional interpolation errors and a sampling quality index that can be computed for any given current‑meter discharge measurement.},

	abstract = {The intersection of the developing topic of rating curve and discharge series uncertainty with the topic of hydrological change detection (e.g., in response to land cover or climatic change) has not yet been well studied. The work herein explores this intersection, with consideration of a long-term discharge response (1964–2007) for a {\textasciitilde}650-km2 headwater basin of the Mara River in west Kenya, starting with stream rating and daily gauge height data. A rating model was calibrated using Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainty intervals in model parameters and predictions. There was an unknown balance of random and systemic error in rating data scatter (a scenario not likely unique to this basin), which led to an unknown balance of noise and information in the calibrated statistical error model. This had implications on testing for hydrological change. Overall, indications were that shifts in basin’s discharge response were rather subtle over the 44-year period. A null hypothesis for change using ﬂow duration curves ({FDCs}) from four different 8-year data intervals could be either accepted or rejected over much of the net ﬂow domain depending on different applications of the statistical error model (each with precedence in the literature). The only unambiguous indication of change in {FDC} comparisons appeared to be a reduction in lowest baseﬂow in recent years (ﬂows with {\textgreater}98\% exceedance probability). We deﬁned a subjective uncertainty interval based on an intermediate balance of random and systematic error in the rating model that suggested a possibility of more prevalent impacts. These results have relevance to management in the Mara basin and to future studies that might establish linkages to historic land use and climatic factors. The concern about uncertain uncertainty intervals (uncertainty2) extends beyond the Mara and is relevant to testing change where non-random rating errors may be important and subtle responses are investigated.

There is a wide variety of techniques to assess discharge uncertainty. However, few studies have developed generalized approaches to quantify discharge uncertainty. This study presents a generalized framework for estimating discharge uncertainty at many gauging stations with different errors in the stage-discharge relationship. The methodology utilizes a nonparametric {LOWESS} regression within a novel framework that accounts for uncertainty in the stagedischarge measurements, scatter in the stage-discharge data and multisection rating curves. The framework was applied to 500 gauging stations in England and Wales and we evaluated the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at low, mean and high ﬂow points on the rating curve. The framework was shown to be robust, versatile and able to capture place-speciﬁc uncertainties for a number of different examples. Our study revealed a wide range of discharge uncertainties (10–397\% discharge uncertainty interval widths), but the majority of the gauging stations (over 80\%) had mean and high ﬂow uncertainty intervals of less than 40\%. We identiﬁed some regional differences in the stage-discharge relationships, however the results show that local conditions dominated in determining the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at a gauging station. This highlights the importance of estimating discharge uncertainty for each gauging station prior to using those data in hydrological analyses.},

First, a summary of the main difficulties encountered in extrapolating rating curves for flood discharge is provided. Then a sensitivity analysis is carried out using a hydraulic modelling approach, applied to eight Mediterranean catchments, and yielding an envelope curve for the stage–discharge relationship, Q(H). To assess the influence of errors in the flood discharge on the uncertainty in estimating extreme floods, a Bayesian framework including a multiplicative error on the rating curve was applied. Its application on two catchments for which historical data are available for the period (1741–2004) shows that ignoring the rating curve errors may lead to an unduly optimistic reduction in the final uncertainty in estimation of flood discharge quantiles. Moreover, the quantile values are also affected by taking into account the rating curve errors.},

This uncertainty stems from two types of error: (a) random errors related to the water-level readings; and (b) systematic errors related to over- or under-estimation of the rating curve. A Bayesian frequency analysis is performed to take both sources of uncertainty into account. It is shown that the uncertainty affecting discharges should be carefully evaluated and taken into account in the flood frequency analysis, as it can increase the quantiles confidence interval.

	abstract = {Maximum flows are often estimated from flood frequency analysis, by means of the statistical fitting of a theoretical probability distribution to maximum annual flow data. However, because of the limitations imposed by the practice of at-site flow measurement, empirical models are applied as the rating curve for estimating streamflow. These curves are approximations of the actual flows and incorporate different sources of uncertainty, especially in the extrapolation portions. These uncertainties are propagated in the frequency analysis and influence the estimated quantiles. For better understanding and describing the influence of the stage-discharge uncertainty in this process, the results of Bayesian rating curve modeling, which considers the physical knowledge of the gauging station as prior information, were combined with Bayesian flood frequency analysis under asymptotic extreme value theory. The method was applied to the Acorizal stream gauging station, located in the interior of the state of Mato Grosso - {BR}. The main results suggested that, although the uncertainties of the rating curve can be relevant in the estimation of maximum flow quantiles, the uncertainties arising from finite-sample inference might exert greater impacts on the flow credibility intervals even for moderate sample sizes.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the joint impact of sample variability and rating curve imprecision in at-site ﬂood frequency analysis. A novel likelihood-based framework is developed for this purpose, assuming a power-law model for the stage-discharge measurements and a generalised extreme value ({GEV}) model for the annual maximum discharges. It is shown that the two models can be pooled into one likelihood function. This allows for simultaneous estimation of the rating curve and {GEV} parameters, and the assessment of the uncertainty of a T-year ﬂood estimate due to both sample variability and rating curve imprecision. Sampling experiments show that (1) the novel method is computationally feasible and little affected by estimation bias, and (2) the chief effect of rating curve imprecision is to inﬂate the estimation variability of the {GEV} quantile estimates. The application of the method to data from 12 Norwegian gauging stations illustrates that (3) the novel and traditional methods give very similar rating curve and {GEV} parameter estimates and (4) the net effect of sample variability and rating curve imprecision can give rise to signiﬁcant wide conﬁdence intervals for the estimated T-year ﬂood.},

The studies concern the period of 60 – 80 years of observation. The trends of riverbed changes during the study period at the selected gauging stations were calculated based on the variability of observed minimal annual water stages. The reasons for the observed changes in the river course and channel geometry are given. These changes were caused by river regulation consisted of the shortening and narrowing of the river channel. Moreover, grain size distribution analysis in the selected gauging stations of Nida River and characteristic diameter variability of sediments along the river course examination are presented. These analyses were to evaluate the variability of characteristic diameters along the river course in connection with observed changes in cross-sections’ geometry. Additionally, to confirm the process of erosion or deposition recognized in the examined river channels, hydrodynamic equilibrium was determined. Three methods were proposed and used: the mean velocity and critical velocity in the main river channel comparison, the stream power value calculation which defines the character of the river channel, and the {WWK} (index of cutting or shallowing of the river channel) index.},

	abstract = {Although discharge estimations are central for water management and hydropower, there are few studies on the variability and uncertainty of their basis; deriving discharge from stage heights through the use of a rating curve that depends on riverbed geometry. A large fraction of the world’s river-discharge stations are presumably located in alluvial channels where riverbed characteristics may change over time because of erosion and sedimentation. This study was conducted to analyse and quantify the dynamic relationship between stage and discharge and to determine to what degree currently used methods are able to account for such variability. The study was carried out for six hydrometric stations in the upper Choluteca River basin, Honduras, where a set of unusually frequent stage–discharge data are available. The temporal variability and the uncertainty of the rating curve and its parameters were analysed through a Monte Carlo ({MC}) analysis on a moving window of data using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation ({GLUE}) methodology. Acceptable ranges for the values of the rating-curve parameters were determined from riverbed surveys at the six stations, and the sampling space was constrained according to those ranges, using three-dimensional alpha shapes. Temporal variability was analysed in three ways: (i) with annually updated rating curves (simulating Honduran practices), (ii) a rating curve for each time window, and (iii) a smoothed, continuous dynamic rating curve derived from the {MC} analysis. The temporal variability of the rating parameters translated into a high rating-curve variability. The variability could turn out as increasing or decreasing trends and/or cyclic behaviour. There was a tendency at all stations to a seasonal variability. The discharge at a given stage could vary by a factor of two or more. The quotient in discharge volumes estimated from dynamic and static rating curves varied between 0.5 and 1.5. The difference between discharge volumes derived from static and dynamic curves was largest for sub-daily ratings but stayed large also for monthly and yearly totals. The relative uncertainty was largest for low ﬂows but it was considerable also for intermediate and large ﬂows. The standard procedure of adjusting rating curves when calculated and observed discharge differ by more than 5\% would have required continuously updated rating curves at the studied locations. We believe that these ﬁndings can be applicable to many other discharge stations around the globe.},

One way of checking the reliability of a climate series is to compare it with surrounding stations. This is the idea behind all tests of the relative homogeneity. Here we will present a simple homogeneity test and apply it to a precipitation data set from south-western Sweden. More precisely we will apply it to ratios between station values and some reference values. The reference value is a form of a mean value from surrounding stations. It is found valuable to include short and incomplete series in the reference value. The test can be used as an instrument for quality control as far as the mean level of, for instance, precipitation is concerned. In practice it should be used along with the available station history. Several non-homogeneities are present in these series and probably reflect a serious source of uncertainty in studies of climatic trends and climatic change all over the world. The significant breaks varied from 5 to 25 per cent for this data set. An example illustrates the importance of using relevant climatic normals that refer to the present measurement conditions in constructing maps of anomalies.},

Presented here are techniques that are suitable in the face of the complications listed above for the exploratory analysis of monthly water quality data for monotonie trends. The first procedure described is a nonparametric test for trend applicable to data sets with seasonality, missing values, or values reported as ‘less than’: the seasonal Kendall test. Under realistic stochastic processes (exhibiting seasonality, skewness, and serial correlation), it is robust in comparison to parametric alternatives, although neither the seasonal Kendall test nor the alternatives can be considered an exact test in the presence of serial correlation. The second procedure, the seasonal Kendall slope estimator, is an estimator of trend magnitude. It is an unbiased estimator of the slope of a linear trend and has considerably higher precision than a regression estimator where data are highly skewed but somewhat lower precision where the data are normal. The third procedure provides a means for testing for change over time in the relationship between constituent concentration and flow, thus avoiding the problem of identifying trends in water quality that are artifacts of the particular sequence of discharges observed (e.g., drought effects). In this method a flow-adjusted concentration is defined as the residual (actual minus conditional expectation) based on a regression of concentration on some function of discharge. These flow-adjusted concentrations, which may also be seasonal and non-normal, can then be tested for trend by using the seasonal Kendall test.},

	abstract = {Les séries temporelles de débit des rivières sont établies à l'aide de "courbes de tarage", qui sont des modèles avec les hauteurs d’eau en entrée et les débits en sortie. Malheureusement, de nombreuses stations hydrométriques ont une relation hauteur-débit instable, notamment à cause de l’évolution du lit de la rivière lors des crues. Ces "détarages" posent problème à la fois pour l'établissement des séries hydrologiques de long-terme (analyse rétrospective) et pour la fourniture de données en temps réel, par exemple pour la prévision des inondations, avec des incertitudes quantifiées et fiables. Les méthodes existantes pour la mise à jour de la courbe de tarage sont basées sur une analyse statistique des données de calibration (jaugeages) passées ou sur des règles empiriques. Cette thèse a permis de développer des méthodes originales pour la détection automatique des détarages et l'estimation de leur amplitude en rétrospectif et en temps réel : une méthode de segmentation des résidus entre les jaugeages et une courbe de référence, une analyse des récessions du limnigramme et une détection de détarages potentiels à partir d'un indicateur disponible en temps réel (par exemple, transport sédimentaire cumulé). L'approche probabiliste permet d'une part de prendre en compte l'incertitude des informations sur les détarages et d'autre part de quantifier les incertitudes sur les débits calculés. La combinaison des trois méthodes a été appliquée à la station de l’Ardèche à Meyras, en France, qui présente des détarages nets après chaque crue importante. Une bonne détection et estimation des détarages a été observée en rétrospectif et en temps réel. La méthode est générale et applicable en opérationnel à d’autres stations après validation. La méthode est générique et, après davantage de validation, applicable en opérationnel à d'autres sites.},

	abstract = {Regional flood frequency analysis is a convenient way to reduce estimation uncertainty when few data are available at the gauging site. In this work, a model that allows a non-null probability to a regional fixed shape parameter is presented. This methodology is integrated within a Bayesian framework and uses reversible jump techniques. The performance on stochastic data of this new estimator is compared to two other models: a conventional Bayesian analysis and the index flood approach. Results show that the proposed estimator is absolutely suited to regional estimation when only a few data are available at the target site. Moreover, unlike the index flood estimator, target site index flood error estimation seems to have less impact on Bayesian estimators. Some suggestions about configurations of the pooling groups are also presented to increase the performance of each estimator.},

	abstract = {There is growing concern that ﬂooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of ﬂood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on ﬂood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The ﬁrst approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed ﬂood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future ﬂoods. Challenges and opportunities associated with ﬂood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in ﬂood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and ﬂood-rich and ﬂoodpoor periods rather than on short duration ﬂood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed ﬂood changes, by validating scenarios against observed ﬂood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of ﬂood changes and feedbacks. The paper ﬁnishes with a call for a joint European ﬂood change research network.},

The study shows that despite widespread consensus in the scientiﬁc literature on the utility of documentary evidence, the actual migration from academic to practical application has been limited. A detailed review of ﬂood frequency estimation guidelines from diﬀerent countries showed that the value of historical data is generally recognised, but practical methods for systematic and routine inclusion of this type of data into risk analysis are in most cases not available. Studies of historical events were identiﬁed in most countries, and good examples of national databases attempting to collate the available information were identiﬁed. The conclusion is that there is considerable potential for improving the reliability of the current ﬂood risk assessments by harvesting the valuable information on past extreme events contained in the historical data sets.},

A list of historical ﬂood levels from 1644 to the present has been drawn up and converted into discharge using hydraulic modelling. A sensitivity analysis provides error intervals on discharge estimates taking into account uncertainties on water level, roughness coefﬁcient and channel geometry, and the impact of a nonpermanent discharge or the backward effect. A ﬂood frequency analysis using systematic and nonsystematic data gives a practical example on how historical information can improve ﬂood knowledge. It reduces the sampling uncertainty and shows also a good agreement with a hydrometeorological approach (Gradex model).},

The review summaries methods and methodologies applied and key findings from a large number of studies. Reported analyses of observed extreme precipitation and flood records show that there is some evidence of a general increase in extreme precipitation, whereas there are no clear indications of significant trends at large-scale regional or national level of extreme streamflow. Several studies from regions dominated by snowmelt-induced peak flows report decreases in extreme streamflow and earlier spring snowmelt peak flows, likely caused by increasing temperature. The review of likely future changes based on climate projections indicates a general increase in extreme precipitation under a future climate, which is consistent with the observed trends. Hydrological projections of peak flows show large impacts in many areas with both positive and negative changes. A general decrease in flood magnitude and earlier spring floods are projected for catchments with snowmelt-dominated peak flows, which is consistent with the observed trends. Finally, existing guidelines in Europe on design flood and design rainfall estimation are reviewed. The review shows that only few countries have developed guidelines that incorporate a consideration of climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {There now exists clear evidence of the impact of climate change on flooding, creating need for new methodologies for design flood estimation that account for warming induced nonstationarity. Current alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis require the specification of a nonstationary probability model (often with time-varying parameters) that requires sufficient data to be stable. Reliance on the trend in observed data often ignores the dissimilar behaviour of frequent and rare quantiles under a warming climate. This, in turn, results in the direction of change to be consistent across both rare and frequent projected flood quantiles. However, results of multiple recent studies suggest that rarer floods are likely to increase while more frequent floods may decrease in magnitude into the future. In this study, we highlight this limitation of existing nonstationary flood frequency approaches and propose a novel nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis approach that captures the differing behaviour of more frequent and rare flood quantiles under a warming climate. The need for longer flood data to model nonstationarity is accommodated by pooling regional information which makes the projections more precise. Data for 105 Australian catchments are used to validate our proposed approach. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the variation of flood quantiles with varying average recurrence intervals in a changing climate. Finally, a few important statistics of future projections are also presented.},

It ‘borrows strength’ from ‘similar’ basins to improve upon inference at a particular basin. The superpopulation is a key concept in the empirical Bayes approach. It is a probability distribution from which basin parameters are randomly assigned, a conceptualization closely related to regionalization models. It is inferred from observable regional data and expresses the degree of basin ‘similarity’ in a region. This approach treats regionalized estimators as a special case and leads to procedures similar to James-Stein estimators. Empirical Bayes procedures can lead to substantial improvements in performance over site-specific procedures. However, for basins which are very different from the majority, site-specific procedures may perform better. The method of moments approach to inferring the superpopulation is considered in detail.

	abstract = {Statistical distributions of flood peak discharge often show heavy tail behavior, that is, extreme floods are more likely to occur than would be predicted by commonly used distributions that have exponential asymptotic behavior. This heavy tail behavior may surprise flood managers and citizens, as human intuition tends to expect light tail behavior, and the heaviness of the tails is very difficult to predict, which may lead to unnecessarily high flood damage. Despite its high importance, the literature on the heavy tail behavior of flood distributions is rather fragmented. In this review, we provide a coherent overview of the processes causing heavy flood tails and the implications for science and practice. Specifically, we propose nine hypotheses on the mechanisms causing heavy tails in flood peak distributions related to processes in the atmosphere, the catchment, and the river system. We then discuss to which extent the current knowledge supports or contradicts these hypotheses. We also discuss the statistical conditions for the emergence of heavy tail behavior based on derived distribution theory and relate them to the hypotheses and flood generation mechanisms. We review the degree to which the heaviness of the tails can be predicted from process knowledge and data. Finally, we recommend further research toward testing the hypotheses and improving the prediction of heavy tails.},

	abstract = {The application of historical ﬂood information as a tool for augmenting instrumental ﬂood data is increasingly recognised as a valuable tool. Most previous studies have focused on large catchments with historic settlements, this paper applies the approach to the smaller lowland system of the Sussex Ouse in southeast England. The reassessment of ﬂood risk on the Sussex Ouse is pertinent in light of the severe ﬂooding in October 2000 and heightened concerns of a perceived increase in ﬂooding nationally. Systematic ﬂood level readings from 1960 and accounts detailing past ﬂood events within the catchment are compiled back to ca. 1750. This extended ﬂood record provides an opportunity to reassess estimates of ﬂood frequency over a timescale not normally possible within ﬂood frequency analysis. This paper re-evaluates ﬂood frequency at Lewes on the Sussex Ouse downstream of the conﬂuence of the Sussex Ouse and River Uck. The paper considers the strengths and weaknesses in estimates resulting from contrasting methods of analysis and their corresponding data: (i) single site analysis of gauged annual maxima; (ii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude; (iii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude exceeding a known threshold, and (iv) sensitivity analysis including only the very largest historical ﬂood events. Use of the historical information was found to yield much tighter conﬁdence intervals of risk estimates, with uncertainty reduced by up to 40 \% for the 100-year return frequency event when historical information was added to the gauged data.},

The approach is based on standard regionalization methods assuming that the ﬂood peak distribution rescaled by a site-dependent index ﬂood is uniform within a homogeneous region. A likelihood formulation and a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm are used to infer the parameter values of the regional distributions. This statistical inference technique has been selected for its rigorousness – various hypotheses are explicitly formulated in the likelihood function, its ﬂexibility as for the type of data that can be treated, and its ability to compute accurate estimates of the conﬁdence intervals for the adjusted parameters and for the corresponding ﬂood quantiles.},

After identification and collection of data on historical floods, several hydraulic models were constructed to account for geomorphological changes. Recent and historical rating curves were constructed and applied to reconstruct flood discharge series, together with their uncertainty. This uncertainty stems from two types of error: (a) random errors related to the water-level readings; and (b) systematic errors related to over- or under-estimation of the rating curve. A Bayesian frequency analysis is performed to take both sources of uncertainty into account. It is shown that the uncertainty affecting discharges should be carefully evaluated and taken into account in the flood frequency analysis, as it can increase the quantiles confidence interval. The quantiles are found to be consistent with those obtained with empirical methods, for two out of four of the catchments.},

The data set consists of daily runoff series collected from the French Banque Hydro Archive. Streamflow indices were selected in order to describe the evolution of high flows. The trend analysis was carried out applying statistical tests to the time series of the streamflow indices. The idea behind the use of regional tests is that stations located in the same region, that are subject to similar climate, are most likely to behave in the same way to the evolution of climate forcings.},

	abstract = {Climate change has led to concerns about increasing river floods resulting from the greater water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere1. These concerns are reinforced by evidence of increasing economic losses associated with flooding in many parts of the world, including Europe2. Any changes in river floods would have lasting implications for the design of flood protection measures and flood risk zoning. However, existing studies have been unable to identify a consistent continental-scale climatic-change signal in flood discharge observations in Europe3, because of the limited spatial coverage and number of hydrometric stations. Here we demonstrate clear regional patterns of both increases and decreases in observed river flood discharges in the past five decades in Europe, which are manifestations of a changing climate. Our results—arising from the most complete database of European flooding so far—suggest that: increasing autumn and winter rainfall has resulted in increasing floods in northwestern Europe; decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in medium and large catchments in southern Europe; and decreasing snow cover and snowmelt, resulting from warmer temperatures, have led to decreasing floods in eastern Europe. Regional flood discharge trends in Europe range from an increase of about 11 per cent per decade to a decrease of 23 per cent. Notwithstanding the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the observational record, the flood changes identified here are broadly consistent with climate model projections for the next century4,5, suggesting that climate-driven changes are already happening and supporting calls for the consideration of climate change in flood risk management.},

Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate.},

	abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage–discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage–discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage–discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to ‘leaky’ catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets. The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events—the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index ({BFI}) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.

	abstract = {Hydrograph recession constants are required in rainfall-runoff models, baseflow augmentation studies, geohydrologic investigations and in regional low-flow studies. The recession portion of a streamflow hydrograph is shown to be either an autoregressive process or an integrated moving average process, depending upon the structure of the assumed model errors. Six different estimators of the baseflow recession constant are derived and tested using thousands of hydrograph recessions available at twenty-three sites in Massachusetts, U.S. When hydrograph recessions are treated as an autoregressive process, unconditional least squares or maximum likelihood estimators of the baseflow recession constant are shown to exhibit significant downward bias due to the short lengths of hydrograph recessions. The precision of estimated of hydrograph recession constants is shown to depend heavily upon assumptions regarding the structure of the model errors. In general, regression procedures for estimating hydrograph recession parameters are generally preferred to the time-series alternatives. An evaluation of the physical significance of estimates of the baseflow recession constant is provided by comparing regional regression models which relate low-flow statistics to three independent variables: drainage area, basin slope and the baseflow recession constant. As anticipated, approximately unbiased estimators of the baseflow recession constant provide significant information regarding the geohydrologic response of watersheds.},

	abstract = {A novel approach to regional flood frequency analysis is presented and evaluated. The technique is referred to as the region of influence approach in that every site can have a potentially unique set of gauging stations for use in the estimation of at-site extremes. The rationale for the methodology is discussed, and several options for incorporating the approach into regional flood frequency analysis are developed and compared with traditional regional estimation procedures. Through a Monte Carlo experiment, the region of influence approach is demonstrated to provide improved at-site estimates of extreme flow quantlies in terms of network average root mean squared error and comparable results for bias. The method is further shown to have attractive features for estimating extremes for unusual sites in a network of gauging stations.},

	abstract = {In this article, an approach using Bayesian Generalised Least Squares ({BGLS}) regression in a region-of-influence ({ROI}) framework is proposed for regional flood frequency analysis ({RFFA}) for ungauged catchments. Using the data from 399 catchments in eastern Australia, the {BGLS}-{ROI} is constructed to regionalise the flood quantiles (Quantile Regression Technique ({QRT})) and the first three moments of the log-Pearson type 3 ({LP}3) distribution (Parameter Regression Technique ({PRT})). This scheme firstly develops a fixed region model to select the best set of predictor variables for use in the subsequent regression analyses using an approach that minimises the model error variance while also satisfying a number of statistical selection criteria. The identified optimal regression equation is then used in the {ROI} experiment where the {ROI} is chosen for a site in question as the region that minimises the predictive uncertainty. To evaluate the overall performances of the quantiles estimated by the {QRT} and {PRT}, a one-at-a-time cross-validation procedure is applied. Results of the proposed method indicate that both the {QRT} and {PRT} in a {BGLS}-{ROI} framework lead to more accurate and reliable estimates of flood quantiles and moments of the {LP}3 distribution when compared to a fixed region approach. Also the {BGLS}-{ROI} can deal reasonably well with the heterogeneity in Australian catchments as evidenced by the regression diagnostics. Based on the evaluation statistics it was found that both {BGLS}-{QRT} and {PRT}-{ROI} perform similarly well, which suggests that the {PRT} is a viable alternative to {QRT} in {RFFA}. The {RFFA} methods developed in this paper is based on the database available in eastern Australia. It is expected that availability of a more comprehensive database (in terms of both quality and quantity) will further improve the predictive performance of both the fixed and {ROI} based {RFFA} methods presented in this study, which however needs to be investigated in future when such a database is available.},

	abstract = {Regression-based methods are widely used in flood regionalization. Since the generalized least squares ({GLS}) regression model properly accounts for both model and sampling errors, realistic estimates of uncertainty can be obtained. This study presents a general Bayesian approach for inferring the {GLS} regional regression model and for combining with any available site information to obtain the most accurate flood quantiles. A robust block Metropolis scheme is developed to sample the posterior distribution of the {GLS} regression model parameters. A particular feature of the sampler is the use of a uniform proposal for the regional model error variance to avoid convergence difficulties. A simple but general procedure, based on importance sampling, is developed to combine any kind of site information with regional information. The benefit of this approach is that all available information is fully exploited, and uncertainty is rigorously quantified as well as being minimized. Two case studies are presented. A synthetic case study illustrates the complex nature of the posterior distribution for the regional model error variance with its shape dependent on how much sampling error dominates the total error in the regional {GLS} model. A second case study involving 24 sites from the east coast of Australia is presented for the log Pearson {III} model. It demonstrates the significant benefit of combining site and regional information and the quantification of uncertainty.},

This paper presents a clear theoretical framework for the use of canonical correlations in regional flood frequency analysis. Some additional results are also presented for the case of gauged target-basins. The approach described in this paper allows one to carry out the determination of homogeneous hydrologic neighborhoods and identifies the variables to use during the step of regional estimation. A data set of 106 stations from the province of Ontario (Canada) is used to demonstrate the advantages of this method and investigate various aspects in relation with its robustness. Results indicate that the method is robust to such factors as the number of stations and the type of parametric distribution being used.

This has attracted the attention of national and international agencies, research institutions, academia, and practicing water specialists, which has led to developing new techniques that may be useful in those cases where there is good evidence and attribution of nonstationarity.

	abstract = {The application of historical ﬂood information as a tool for augmenting instrumental ﬂood data is increasingly recognised as a valuable tool. Most previous studies have focused on large catchments with historic settlements, this paper applies the approach to the smaller lowland system of the Sussex Ouse in southeast England. The reassessment of ﬂood risk on the Sussex Ouse is pertinent in light of the severe ﬂooding in October 2000 and heightened concerns of a perceived increase in ﬂooding nationally. Systematic ﬂood level readings from 1960 and accounts detailing past ﬂood events within the catchment are compiled back to ca. 1750. This extended ﬂood record provides an opportunity to reassess estimates of ﬂood frequency over a timescale not normally possible within ﬂood frequency analysis. This paper re-evaluates ﬂood frequency at Lewes on the Sussex Ouse downstream of the conﬂuence of the Sussex Ouse and River Uck. The paper considers the strengths and weaknesses in estimates resulting from contrasting methods of analysis and their corresponding data: (i) single site analysis of gauged annual maxima; (ii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude; (iii) combined analysis of systematic annual maxima augmented with historical peaks of estimated magnitude exceeding a known threshold, and (iv) sensitivity analysis including only the very largest historical ﬂood events. Use of the historical information was found to yield much tighter conﬁdence intervals of risk estimates, with uncertainty reduced by up to 40 \% for the 100-year return frequency event when historical information was added to the gauged data.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Historical records are an important source of information on extreme and rare floods and fundamental to establish a reliable flood return frequency. The use of long historical records for flood frequency analysis brings in the question of flood stationarity, since climatic and land-use conditions can affect the relevance of past flooding as a predictor of future flooding. In this paper, a detailed 400 yr flood record from the Tagus River in Aranjuez (central Spain) was analysed under stationary and non-stationary flood frequency approaches, to assess their contribution within hazard studies. Historical flood records in Aranjuez were obtained from documents (Proceedings of the City Council, diaries, chronicles, memoirs, etc.), epigraphic marks, and indirect historical sources and reports. The water levels associated with different floods (derived from descriptions or epigraphic marks) were computed into discharge values using a one-dimensional hydraulic model. Secular variations in flood magnitude and frequency, found to respond to climate and environmental drivers, showed a good correlation between high values of historical flood discharges and a negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) index. Over the systematic gauge record (1913–2008), an abrupt change on flood magnitude was produced in 1957 due to constructions of three major reservoirs in the Tagus headwaters (Bolarque, Entrepeñas and Buendia) controlling 80\% of the watershed surface draining to Aranjuez. Two different models were used for the flood frequency analysis: (a) a stationary model estimating statistical distributions incorporating imprecise and categorical data based on maximum likelihood estimators, and (b) a time-varying model based on "generalized additive models for location, scale and shape" ({GAMLSS}) modelling, which incorporates external covariates related to climate variability ({NAO} index) and catchment hydrology factors (in this paper a reservoir index; {RI}). Flood frequency analysis using documentary data (plus gauged records) improved the estimates of the probabilities of rare floods (return intervals of 100 yr and higher). Under non-stationary modelling flood occurrence associated with an exceedance probability of 0.01 (i.e. return period of 100 yr) has changed over the last 500 yr due to decadal and multi-decadal variability of the {NAO}. Yet, frequency analysis under stationary models was successful in providing an average discharge around which value flood quantiles estimated by non-stationary models fluctuate through time.},

In historical ﬂoods reconstruction, due to the lower precision of input data, the magnitude of this uncertainty could reach a high value. With the objectives of giving an estimate of the peak ﬂow error of a typical historical ﬂood reconstruction with the model {HEC}-{RAS} and of providing a quick, simple uncertainty assessment that an end user could easily apply, the uncertainty of the reconstructed peak ﬂow of a major ﬂood in the Ebro River ({NE} Iberian Peninsula) was calculated with a set of local sensitivity analyses on six input variables. The peak ﬂow total error was estimated at ±31\% and water height was found to be the most inﬂuential variable on peak ﬂow, followed by Manning’s n. However, the latter, due to its large uncertainty, was the greatest contributor to peak ﬂow total error. Besides, the {HEC}-{RAS} resulting peak ﬂow was compared to the ones obtained with the 2D model Iber and with Manning’s equation; all three methods gave similar peak ﬂows. Manning’s equation gave almost the same result than {HEC}-{RAS}. The main conclusion is that, to ensure the lowest peak ﬂow error, the reliability and precision of the ﬂood mark should be thoroughly assessed.},

Palaeoflood modelling research has largely focused on one-dimensional analysis for geomorphologically stable fluvial settings because two-dimensional analysis for dynamic alluvial settings is time consuming and requires a detailed representation of the past landscape. In this study, we make the step to spatially continuous palaeoflood modelling for a large and dynamic lowland area. We applied advanced hydraulic model simulations (1D–2D coupled set-up in {HEC}-{RAS} with 950 channel sections and 108 × 103 floodplain grid cells) to quantify the extent and magnitude of past floods in the Lower Rhine river valley and upper delta. As input, we used a high-resolution terrain reconstruction (palaeo-{DEM}) of the area in early mediaeval times, complemented with hydraulic roughness values. After conducting a series of model runs with increasing discharge magnitudes at the upstream boundary, we compared the simulated flood water levels with an inventory of exceeded and non-exceeded elevations extracted from various geological, archaeological and historical sources. This comparison demonstrated a Lower Rhine millennial flood magnitude of approximately 14,000 m3/s for the Late Holocene period before late mediaeval times. This value exceeds the largest measured discharges in the instrumental record, but not the design discharges currently accounted for in flood risk management.},

Two categories of historical information are considered: “censored” data, where the magnitudes of historical flood peaks are known; and “binomial” data, where only threshold exceedance information is available. A Monte Carlo study employing the two-parameter lognormal distribution shows that maximum likelihood estimators ({MLEs}) can extract the equivalent of an additional 10–30 years of gage record from a 50-year period of historical observation. The {MLE} routines are shown to be substantially better than an adjusted-moment estimator similar to the one recommended in Bulletin 17B of the United States Water Resources Council Hydrology Committee (1982). The {MLE} methods performed well even when floods were drawn from other than the assumed lognormal distribution.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a Bayesian statistical model for estimating ﬂood frequency by combining uncertain annual maximum ({AMAX}) data from a river gauge with estimates of ﬂood peak discharge from various historic sources that predate the period of instrument records. Such historic ﬂood records promise to expand the time series data needed for reducing the uncertainty in return period estimates for extreme events, but the heterogeneity and uncertainty of historic records make them difﬁcult to use alongside Flood Estimation Handbook and other standard methods for generating ﬂood frequency curves from gauge data. Using the ﬂow of the River Eden in Carlisle, Cumbria, {UK} as a case study, this paper develops a Bayesian model for combining historic ﬂood estimates since 1800 with gauge data since 1967 to estimate the probability of low frequency ﬂood events for the area taking account of uncertainty in the discharge estimates. Results show a reduction in 95\% conﬁdence intervals of roughly 50\% for annual exceedance probabilities of less than 0.0133 (return periods over 75 years) compared to standard ﬂood frequency estimation methods using solely systematic data. Sensitivity analysis shows the model is sensitive to 2 model parameters both of which are concerned with the historic (pre-systematic) period of the time series. This highlights the importance of adequate consideration of historic channel and ﬂoodplain changes or possible bias in estimates of historic ﬂood discharges. The next steps required to roll out this Bayesian approach for operational ﬂood frequency estimation at other sites is also discussed. Ó 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The paper describes a simple method of incorporating such data into probability analyses and illustrates it by application to the probability analysis of ice breakup stages on the Peace River at Fort Vermilion, Alberta, Canada. There is generally little standard hydrometric information on such water levels, yet they are often a very significant component of the annual maximum water levels in cold regions. In such situations the analysis of historical data is particularly important.},

	abstract = {Flood disaster mitigation strategies should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the flood risk combined with a thorough investigation of the uncertainties associated with the risk assessment procedure. Within the "German Research Network of Natural Disasters" ({DFNK}) the working group "Flood Risk Analysis" investigated the flood process chain from precipitation, runoff generation and concentration in the catchment, flood routing in the river network, possible failure of flood protection measures, inundation to economic damage. The working group represented each of these processes by deterministic, spatially distributed models at different scales. While these models provide the necessary understanding of the flood process chain, they are not suitable for risk and uncertainty analyses due to their complex nature and high {CPU}-time demand. We have therefore developed a stochastic flood risk model consisting of simplified model components associated with the components of the process chain. We parameterised these model components based on the results of the complex deterministic models and used them for the risk and uncertainty analysis in a Monte Carlo framework. The Monte Carlo framework is hierarchically structured in two layers representing two different sources of uncertainty, aleatory uncertainty (due to natural and anthropogenic variability) and epistemic uncertainty (due to incomplete knowledge of the system). The model allows us to calculate probabilities of occurrence for events of different magnitudes along with the expected economic damage in a target area in the first layer of the Monte Carlo framework, i.e. to assess the economic risks, and to derive uncertainty bounds associated with these risks in the second layer. It is also possible to identify the contributions of individual sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty. It could be shown that the uncertainty caused by epistemic sources significantly alters the results obtained with aleatory uncertainty alone. The model was applied to reaches of the river Rhine downstream of Cologne.},

One would expect that an estimate of the historical maximum event; i.e., the maximum flood in a period of perhaps 100–200 years, would, if properly included in the estimation procedure, improve the resulting estimate of the flood magnitude at the given return period. We attempt to assess the value of historical information using computer simulation. An annual flood sequence and a historical maximum event are generated from ah extreme-value distribution (of type I or {II}) and quantitiles of the distribution are estimated by maximum likelihood, both including the excluding the historical event. After many such simulations have been performed the accuracy of the quantile estimates is assessed. We also consider the effect of errors in the magnitude of historical discharge estimates and the use of historical data in regional flood frequency analysis.},

In the United Kingdom, the Flood Estimation Handbook ({FEH}) methodologies are used by practitioners to estimate flood flows. Until recently it was challenging for practitioners to include additional non-continuous flood information, such as historical flood descriptions from historical archives, in their analyses, to reduce the uncertainty within the {FEH} approaches. This paper shows how Bayesian statistical methods can be applied to historical data which have degrees of uncertainty associated with then to improve design flood flows. The paper uses the River Avon at Evesham in the United Kingdom as a case study to illustrate the advantages of the method. The inclusion of historical information at this site improves the estimates of the one in 100 year flood flow compared to the values generated by the {FEH} pooling group method. The paper makes recommendations as to how practitioners could be encouraged to use historical flood water levels in their analysis of floods more regularly.},

	abstract = {After an introduction to the traditional flood frequency analysis methods, this article discusses their limits and the risks associated with their thoughtless use: overconfidence in the estimated values of flood quantiles or return periods and systematic underestimation of risks. The article then presents and illustrates the added value of modern Bayesian flood frequency inference procedures that are statistically consistent, numerically accurate, and now computationally affordable. The implementation of such methods shows that estimated flood frequencies, based on observed samples of limited size, are generally affected by large uncertainties. This acknowledgement should be an incentive for increasing the size of the analyzed samples through a more systematic use of historic information as well as regional approaches in flood frequency analyses. It also clearly points out that the margin of errors should be considered when using inference results for design or risk assessment purposes. Several pieces of software are now available to conduct Bayesian flood frequency analyses relatively straightforwardly. There is no remaining obstacle to the implementation of these modern approaches in operational hydrological studies.

The study shows that despite widespread consensus in the scientific literature on the utility of documentary evidence, the actual migration from academic to practical application has been limited. A detailed review of flood frequency estimation guidelines from different countries showed that the value of historical data is generally recognised, but practical methods for systematic and routine inclusion of this type of data into risk analysis are in most cases not available. Studies of historical events were identified in most countries, and good examples of national databases attempting to collate the available information were identified. The conclusion is that there is considerable potential for improving the reliability of the current flood risk assessments by harvesting the valuable information on past extreme events contained in the historical data sets.},

	abstract = {The existing attitude that the criterion for choice of plotting position is arbitrary is rebuked and it is shown that a worthwhile criterion can be based on desired statistical properties of the plot, rather than on comparison of plotting positions with estimates of probability for individual sample values. These properties are that any quantile estimate made from the plot should be unbiased and should have smallest mean square error among all such estimates. This leads to specification of plotting position initially in terms of reduced variate rather than probability value. The unbiased plotting position is E(y(i)), the mean of the ith order statistic in samples from the reduced variate population, which differs from one distribution to another. A good approximation for each distribution is available in the probability domain. These take the general form (i − α)(N + 1 − 2α) with α = 38 in the normal case and α = 0.44 in the extreme-value type-1 ({EV}1) and exponential cases. The Weibull formula, α = 0, is correct for the uniform distribution alone and is shown to be biased for other distributions. Hazen's formula α = 12 shows up much better in terms of bias than many would expect. If a single simple distribution free formula were required then α = 25 would be the best compromise. The plotting position postulates which have supported the Weibull formula for many years are examined and some are seen to be unreasonable in view of statistical facts.},

	abstract = {Flood frequency analyses are often based on recorded series at gauging stations. However, the length of the available data sets is usually too short to provide reliable estimates of extreme design ﬂoods. Hence, hydrologists have tried to make use of alternative sources of information to enrich the datasets used for the statistical inferences. Two main approaches were therefore proposed. The ﬁrst consists in extending the information in time, making use of historical and paleoﬂood data. The second, spatial extension, consists in merging statistically homogeneous data to build large regional data samples. Recently, a combination of the two techniques aiming at including estimated extreme discharges at ungauged sites of a region in the regional ﬂood frequency analyses has been proposed. This paper presents a consolidation of this approach and its comparison with the standard regional ﬂood frequency approach proposed by Hosking \& Wallis. A modiﬁcation of the likelihood function is introduced to enable the simultaneous calibration of a regional index ﬂood relation and of the parameters of the regional growth curve. Moreover, the efﬁciency of the proposed method is evaluated based on a large number of Monte Carlo simulated data sets. This work conﬁrms that extreme peak discharges estimated at ungauged sites may be of great value for the evaluation of large return period (typically over 100 years) ﬂood quantiles. They should therefore not be neglected despite the uncertainties associated to these estimates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Glomma river is the largest in Norway with a catchment area of 154 450 km2. People living near the shores of this river are frequently exposed to destructive floods that impair local cities and communities. Unfortunately, design flood predictions are hampered by uncertainty since the standard flood records are much shorter than the requested return period and also the climate is expected to change in the coming decades. Here we combine systematic- historical and paleo-information in an effort to improve flood frequency analysis and better understand potential linkages to both climate and non-climatic forcing. Specifically, we (i) compile historical flood data from the existing literature, (ii) produce high resolution X-ray fluorescence ({XRF}), Magnetic Susceptibility ({MS}) and Computed Tomography ({CT}) scanning data from a sediment core covering the last 10 300 years, and (iii) integrate these data sets in order to better estimate design floods and assess non-stationarities. Based on observations from Lake Flyginnsjøen, receiving sediments from Glomma only when it reaches a certain threshold, we can estimate flood frequency in a moving window of 50 years across millennia revealing that past flood frequency is non-stationary on different time scales. We observe that periods with increased flood activity (4000–2000 years ago and},

Lead-210, caesium-137, and geochemical analysis of mining-contaminated slackwater ﬂood sediments have been used to reconstruct the history of these ﬂood deposits. These age controls were combined with the continuous record of Gardon ﬂow since 1890, and the combined records were then used to assign ages to slackwater deposits. The stratigraphic records of terrace {GE} and cave {GG} were excellent examples to illustrate the effects of erosion/preservation in a context of a progressively self-censoring, vertically accreting sequence. The sedimentary ﬂood record of the terrace {GE} located at 10 m above the channel bed is complete for years post-1958 but incomplete before. During the 78-year period 1880–1958, 25 ﬂoods of a sufﬁcient magnitude (N 1450 m3/s) have covered the terrace. Since 1958, however, the frequency of inundation of the deposits has been lower: only 5 or 6 ﬂoods in 52 years have been large enough to exceed the necessary threshold discharge (N1700 m3/s). The progressive increase of the threshold discharge and the reduced frequency of inundation at the terrace could allow stabilization of the vegetation cover and improve protection against erosion from subsequent large magnitude ﬂood events. The sedimentary ﬂood record seems complete for cave {GG} located at 15 m above the channel bed. Here, the low frequency of events would have enabled a high degree of stabilization of the sedimentary ﬂood record, rendering the deposits less susceptible to erosion.},

In probabilistic terms, the task is to model the joint distribution of several spatially distributed variables, and how it varies in time. This paper describes a Bayesian hierarchical framework for this purpose. Each variable follows a distribution with parameters varying in both space and time. Temporal variability is modeled by means of hidden climate indices ({HCIs}) that are extracted from observed variables. This is to be contrasted with the usual approach using predefined standard climate indices ({SCIs}) for this purpose. In the second level of the model, the {HCIs} and their effects are assumed to follow temporal and spatial Gaussian processes, respectively. Both intervariable and intersite dependencies are induced by the strong effect of common {HCIs}. The flexibility of the framework is illustrated with a case study in Southeast Australia aimed at modeling “hot-and-dry” summer conditions. It involves three physical variables (streamflow, precipitation, and temperature) measured on three distinct station networks, with varying data availability and representing hundreds of sites in total. The {HCI} model delivers reliable and sharp time-varying distributions for individual variables and sites. In addition, it adequately reproduces intervariable and intersite dependencies, whereas a corresponding {SCI} model (where hidden climate indices are replaced with standard ones) strongly underestimates them. It is finally suggested that {HCI} models may be used as downscaling tools to estimate the joint distribution of several variables at many stations from climate models or reanalyzes.},

	abstract = {The use of the generalized least squares ({GLS}) technique for estimation of hydrological regression models has become good practice in hydrology. Through a regression model, a simple link between a particular hydrological variable and a set of catchment descriptors can be established. The regression residuals can be treated as the sum of sampling errors in the hydrological variable and errors in the regression model. This article presents a method for exploring and developing a parameterized form for the cross-correlation between the regression model errors. Given an initial {GLS} analysis, a reweighted set of regression residuals is defined such that the covariance of these residuals is essentially similar to that of the model errors. The cross-products of the reweighted regression residuals, pooled within bins, are then used to identify a structure and to fit a parameterized form for the cross-correlations of the regression errors. These estimated cross-correlations are then used to inform improved {GLS} and reweighting steps, leading to a recursive procedure. The main advantage of the recursive {GLS} procedure is that it allows for a simple demonstration of the actual existence of model error correlation as well as for exploring suitable models for the correlation. However, while the procedure for identifying a parametric description for the model error correlation is reasonable, estimation of the parameters within the recursive procedure is affected by the data-binning step. Thus it is suggested that once a structure for the correlation has been decided, further data analysis—such as final decisions about variables included in the regression model and final estimation of parameters—should be undertaken within a maximum likelihood framework. The procedure has been tested on annual maximum flow data from 602 catchments located throughout the United Kingdom. A set of Monte Carlo experiments further confirmed the ability of the recursive {GLS} procedure to correctly identify and estimate the true model error correlation.},

	abstract = {Regional frequency analysis ({RFA}) has a long history in hydrology, and numerous distinct approaches have been proposed over the years to perform the estimation of some hydrologic quantity at a regional level. However, most of these approaches still rely on strong hypotheses that may limit their application and complicate the quantification of predictive uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to propose a general Bayesian hierarchical framework to implement {RFA} schemes that avoid these difficulties. The proposed framework is based on a two-level hierarchical model. The first level of the hierarchy describes the joint distribution of observations. An arbitrary marginal distribution, whose parameters may vary in space, is assumed for at-site series. The joint distribution is then derived by means of an elliptical copula, therefore providing an explicit description of the spatial dependence between data. The second level of the hierarchy describes the spatial variability of parameters using a regression model that links the parameter values with covariates describing site characteristics. Regression errors are modeled with a Gaussian spatial field, which may exhibit spatial dependence. This framework enables performing prediction at both gaged and ungaged sites and, importantly, rigorously quantifying the associated predictive uncertainty. A case study based on the annual maxima of daily rainfall demonstrates the applicability of this hierarchical approach. Although numerous avenues for improvement can already be identified (among which is the inclusion of temporal covariates to model time variability), the proposed model constitutes a general framework for implementing flexible {RFA} schemes and quantifying the associated predictive uncertainty.},

The French flood forecasting services, together with Cerema, decided to provide technical and organizational solutions in order to set up a collaborative management approach of high-water marks data. On the one hand, a methodological handbook has been produced, giving recommendations for post-flood field investigations. It comes with a dedicated {PDA} tool and a {PC} desktop software. On the other hand, a national repository has been built, making it possible to gather the large range of informations usually needed. This repository is combined with a collaborative web platform, which aims to be a way of public access to the available information, a working tool for technical users, and a front door to contribute to the inventory. The last step of this approach is the setting of an organization blue-print including all the stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in high-water marks knowledge.},

It appears to be a convenient framework for deriving complex models in agreement with both physical reality and statistical requirements. The aim of this paper is to present an application to the regional frequency analysis of extremes in a nonstationary context. A nonstationary regional model is thus proposed, together with the related hypotheses. The Bayesian inference of this model is then described. Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods are needed for this purpose because of the dimensionality of the model and are described in this paper. The usefulness of such a model is then illustrated on a hydrological case study concerning annual maximum discharges of several sites. The advantage of regional analysis compared to at-site estimation is thus highlighted. Moreover, the Bayesian framework allows for a direct and comprehensive inference based on the posterior distribution and is able to take into account modeling uncertainties, which is particularly useful when the stationarity of a series can neither be ensured nor be totally rejected.},

The whole dataset was integrated into a Geographic Information System to determine coastline retreat and advance and to quantify gains and losses of land area at the coastal fringe of the delta. It is shown that sediment input from the Rhône, longshore drift currents and sea defences have had a marked influence on space-time variations of the position of the coastline. These data enable characterisation of the morphose- dimentary circulation at the coast, and the identification of a clear pattern of littoral sediment cells.},

	title = {Estimation des niveaux marins extrêmes avec et sans l’action des vagues le long du littoral métropolitain},
	url = {https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01277151},
	abstract = {Pour caractériser le risque de submersion marine, il est très important d'avoir une connaissance précise des lois de distribution des niveaux d'eau marins, et plus particulièrement des niveaux d'eau extrêmes. En effet ce sont eux qui sont à l'origine des conséquences les plus dramatiques. Le programme de recherche mené au cours de cette thèse a été financé par le Ministère de l'Écologie, du Développement Durable et de l'Énergie. L'objectif final est de fournir des valeurs de référence de niveau d'eau marin le long des côtes françaises, par le biais d'une méthode d'analyse statistique des extrêmes. Ces niveaux comprennent les trois composantes suivantes : la marée, la surcote météorologique et le wave set-up. Le principe de base utilisé est le suivant : une analyse statistique est effectuée aux ports où la donnée marégraphique est disponible, puis le résultat est interpolé entre les ports. Différentes approches sont testées. Les points suivants sont en particulier étudiés :- la dépendance marée surcote, avec deux différents types de dépendance, une dépendance temporelle et une dépendance en amplitude ;- la méthode d'interpolation, avec la comparaison d'une analyse site-par-site ({ASS}) avec une analyse régionale ({RFA}), et celle d'interpolations 1D et 2D ;- l'estimation du wave set-up, basée sur l'état de l'art des formules paramétriques ;- la dépendance surcote vagues, avec des lois bi-variées de valeurs extrêmes. Le résultat final se présente sous la forme de deux profils de niveau d'eau de période de retour 100 ans : le premier sans l'action des vagues (marée et surcote météorologique) et le deuxième avec l'action des vagues. Les valeurs les plus élevées sont atteintes, pour le littoral de la Mer du Nord, la Manche et l'Atlantique, en Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel (à cause des conditions de marée), et pour le littoral méditerranéen au niveau de Marseille. L'analyse montre que la modélisation de la dépendance temporelle marée surcote n'influe pas significativement sur les estimations des valeurs extrêmes. Par contre la modélisation de la dépendance en amplitude donne des résultats intéressants pour certains ports. En comparaison avec l'{ASS}, la {RFA} tend à lisser les résultats. Les estimations issues de la {RFA} sont supérieures pour le littoral méditerranéen, et équivalentes pour le littoral de Mer du Nord, Manche et Atlantique. La {RFA} serait recommandée pour l'estimation des niveaux de retour en dehors du domaine de validité de l'{ASS}.À cause du petit nombre de sites d'observation, il est préféré une interpolation 1D le long du trait de côte lissé. Le wave set-up est calculé par la formule de Dean et Walton [2009].La dépendance surcote vagues est moyenne le long du littoral méditerranéen. Le facteur de dépendance montre des variations plus importantes le long du littoral de Mer du Nord, Manche et Atlantique, avec un maximum observé en Baie de Seine et des minima en Baie de Mont-Saint-Michel et au niveau de Calais. Des suggestions sont faites pour améliorer les méthodologies développées et appliquées dans le cadre d'un futur travail},

If anything, flood magnitudes are decreasing despite widespread claims by the climate community that if precipitation extremes increase, floods must also. In this commentary we suggest reasons why increases in extreme rainfall are not resulting in corresponding increases in flooding. Among the possible mechanisms responsible, we identify decreases in antecedent soil moisture, decreasing storm extent, and decreases in snowmelt. We argue that understanding the link between changes in precipitation and changes in flooding is a grand challenge for the hydrologic community and is deserving of increased attention.},

Of these, 1.24 billion are located in South and East Asia, where China (395 million) and India (390 million) account for over one-third of global exposure. Low- and middle-income countries are home to 89\% of the world’s flood-exposed people. Of the 170 million facing high flood risk and extreme poverty (living on under \$1.90 per day), 44\% are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

	abstract = {Heavy precipitation over western Germany and neighboring countries in July 2021 led to widespread floods, with the Ahr and Erft river catchments being particularly affected. Following the event characterization and process analysis in Part 1, here we put the 2021 event in the historical context regarding precipitation and discharge records and in terms of the temporal transformation of the valley morphology. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of ongoing and future climate change on the modification of rainfall totals and the associated flood hazard, as well as implications for flood management.

 The event was among the five heaviest precipitation events of the past 70 years in Germany. However, consideration of the large {LAERTES}-{EU} regional climate model ({RCM}) ensemble revealed a substantial underestimation of both return levels and periods based on extreme value statistics using only observations. An analysis of homogeneous hydrological data of the last 70 years demonstrated that the event discharges exceeded by far the statistical 100-year return levels. Nevertheless, the flood peaks at the Ahr river were comparable to the reconstructed major historical events of 1804 and 1910, which were not included in the flood risk assessment so far. A comparison between the 2021 and past events showed differences in terms of the observed hydro-morphodynamic processes which enhanced the flood risk due to changes in the landscape organization and occupation.

 The role of climate change and how the 2021 event would unfold under warmer or colder conditions (within a −2 to +3 K range) was considered based on both a pseudo global warming ({PGW}) model experiments and the analysis of an {RCM} ensemble. The {PGW} experiments showed that the spatial mean precipitation scales with the theoretical Clausius–Clapeyron ({CC}) relation, predicting a 7 \% to 9 \% increase per degree of warming. Using the {PGW} rainfall simulations as input to a hydrological model of the Ahr river basin revealed a strong and non-linear effect on flood peaks: for the +2 K scenario, the 18 \% increase in areal rainfall led to a 39 \% increase of the flood peak at gauge Altenahr. The analysis of the high-resolution convection-permitting {KIT}-{KLIWA} {RCM} ensemble confirmed the {CC} scaling for moderate spatial mean precipitation but showed a super {CC} scaling of up to 10 \% for higher intensities. Moreover, the spatial extent of such precipitation events is also expected to increase.},

	abstract = {Statistical distributions of flood peak discharge often show heavy tail behavior, that is, extreme floods are more likely to occur than would be predicted by commonly used distributions that have exponential asymptotic behavior. This heavy tail behavior may surprise flood managers and citizens, as human intuition tends to expect light tail behavior, and the heaviness of the tails is very difficult to predict, which may lead to unnecessarily high flood damage. Despite its high importance, the literature on the heavy tail behavior of flood distributions is rather fragmented. In this review, we provide a coherent overview of the processes causing heavy flood tails and the implications for science and practice. Specifically, we propose nine hypotheses on the mechanisms causing heavy tails in flood peak distributions related to processes in the atmosphere, the catchment, and the river system. We then discuss to which extent the current knowledge supports or contradicts these hypotheses. We also discuss the statistical conditions for the emergence of heavy tail behavior based on derived distribution theory and relate them to the hypotheses and flood generation mechanisms. We review the degree to which the heaviness of the tails can be predicted from process knowledge and data. Finally, we recommend further research toward testing the hypotheses and improving the prediction of heavy tails.},

	abstract = {A generic framework is proposed to evaluate the relative discharge error made when ignoring stage-discharge hysteresis due to transient flow over large gauging station networks. The diagnosis is conducted using the Jones equation, a simple hydraulic concept relating discharge to stage and its time-gradient. The input data used for the method are the flow resistance coefficients, the temporal stage gradients, and the bed slopes. The hys­ teresis effect is quantified for each gauging station and mapped using the relative discharge error. The method was applied to 2618 gauging stations of France’s national hydrometry network using data extracted from the national hydrological archive and from Digital Terrain Models. The diagnostic results highly depend on slope estimates used as inputs. Substantial hysteresis effects were found at stations with low bed slope combined with a fast flood regime. The application to France shows the difficulty of drawing a firm conclusion about stations prone to hysteresis due to the slope data uncertainty. This issue is not specific to France; slope estimates over a network of hydrometric stations are difficult to obtain in many countries. The use of local bed slope estimates is recommended to approach the slopes of the reaches controlling the station stage-discharge relation.},

This paper aims at exploring the use of a one-dimensional (1-D) hydrodynamical model for understanding the source and fate of {SPM} during complex events. The numerical model was applied to the May–June 2008 ﬂood in the Lower Rhône River, France. This event was a combination of ﬂoods of the Isère (including dam ﬂushing operations in the Lower Isère River) and Durance tributaries over a two-week period. The simulation code was used to model the {SPM} ﬂuxes at a high spatial and temporal resolution using a multi-class approach. Approximately half of the 4.9 Mt of {SPM} measured at the outlet at Beaucaire were found to come from the Isère River and the other half from the Durance River, whereas previous studies estimated that most of the {SPM} ﬂux at the outlet came from the Durance River. The amount of {SPM} trapped within the river network, mainly behind the ﬁrst hydropower structure downstream of the Isère conﬂuence, was estimated to be 3.7 Mt due to the deposition of the coarsest particles. Such a model proved to be able to compute the interaction of various grain size classes with dams and other structures. In turn, the quality of the results of {SPM} ﬂuxes and deposition is highly sensitive to particle parameters, especially grain size distribution, and to the operational rules of reservoirs.},

A crucial step in this analysis is transferring available information from gauged sites to ungauged sites, which is achieved through delineation of homogeneous regions encompassing multiple catchment locations, followed by the formulation of a flood estimation model. While this process has been accomplished through a range of statistical homogenization alternatives, the present study offers a new approach rooted in the theory of complex networks, offering considerable advantages over what is traditionally followed. Data from 202 sites in Australia representing catchments of varying geographic, climatic, and vegetation attributes are used to assess the alternative proposed. The results are examined via (1) direct comparison of the location and number of homogeneous neighbors from network theory with results using canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}) and (2) assessing the accuracy of estimated flood quantiles by applying a common model that estimates flood quantiles using information from the two alternate groups of homogeneous sites (from network theory and {CCA}). Results show that network theory offers merit in delineating homogenous regions, with resulting design flood estimates showing improvements across different return periods compared to the {CCA} alternative used.},

	abstract = {Paleoflood hydrology is the study of past or ancient flood events. The most accurate technique involves the analysis of slackwater deposits and paleostage indicators ({SWD}-{PSI}). Slackwater deposits are sand and silt emplaced from suspension in exceptionally deep, high-velocity floods that characterize narrow, deep canyons in resistant geologic materials. These and other paleostage indicators are used to establish hydraulic grade lines for the generating flow events. Favorable sites for slackwater deposition include channel-margin areas where stresses and velocities are reduced below critical values necessary to maintain fine-grained bedload material (sand and silt) in suspension. Computerized procedures for hydraulic flow modeling are used to tie the elevations of the highest slackwater deposits to surveyed river cross sections. The flood discharges calculated by this method can be calibrated through the study of modern floods on gaged rivers. Correlation of multiple {SWD}-{PSI} sites along a river reach is used to identify the maximum paleostage achieved by a given flood. Advances in the dating of flood deposits permit estimates of flood frequency to be made extending over a data base of thousands of years. The major geochronologic tool is radiocarbon dating of various kinds of organic matter intercalated with the slackwater deposits. An important development is the use of the tandem accelerator mass spectrometer for direct measurement of 14C. Tiny blebs of charcoal, seeds and other organics can be analyzed in order to date ancient flood deposits of hydrologic significance. Since {SWD}-{PSI} studies yield very accurate determinations of paleoflood ages and magnitudes, there is a pressing need for new statistical procedures that make optimum use of the information content in paleoflood records for flood-frequency analysis. Nevertheless, {SWD}-{PSI} paleoflood hydrology has moved beyond the research phase; its use should be encouraged in evaluating past experience of extraordinary floods at appropriate hazardous sites.},

This paper describes dendrochronological techniques available in riparian environments and applies them to a small reach of the Hawkesbury River. Results of field investigations into the relationships between flooding and associated tree-ring variability were used to reconstruct partial duration flood-frequency data. The ring-width chronologies of 39 trees were transformed into three indices that made interpretation with respect to flooding possible: (1) a width-index: (2) an annual-sensitivity ({AS}) index; and (3) a tilting vector. It was assumed that floods would either suppress growth or alter the annual distribution of new wood about the tree bole. Width-indicies and tilting vectors provided the most reliable flooding information. Much reduced growth rates at low elevations supported initial hypotheses and led to the establishment of a relationship between growth-rate and frequency of inundation. The reconstructed flood-frequency curve closely matched the historical data-set although underestimation occured at higher levels due to limited sample size. Analyses indicate that dendrochronological investigations of exotic riparian trees provide detailed flooding information, but techniques may also be used to provide minimum dates of fluvial landforms and date recent channel changes.},

This information has the potential to greatly improve current flood design and risk assessment approaches, which are hampered by the shortness and scarcity of gauge records. For this reason, paleoflood hydrology from lake sediments received fast-growing attention over the last decade. This allowed an extensive development of experience and methodologies and, thereby, the reconstruction of paleoflood series with increasingly higher accuracy. In this review, we provide up-to-date knowledge on flood sedimentary processes and systems, as well as on state-of-the-art methods for reconstructing and interpreting paleoflood records. We also discuss possible perspectives in the field of paleoflood hydrology from lake sediments by highlighting the remaining challenges. This review intends to guide the research interest in documenting past floods from lake sediments. In particular, we offer here guidance supported by the literature in how: to choose the most appropriate lake in a given region, to find the best suited sedimentary environments to take the cores, to identify flood deposits in the sedimentary sequence, to distinguish them from other instantaneous deposits, and finally, to rigorously interpret the flood chronicle thus produced.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Glomma river is the largest in Norway with a catchment area of 154 450 km2. People living near the shores of this river are frequently exposed to destructive floods that impair local cities and communities. Unfortunately, design flood predictions are hampered by uncertainty since the standard flood records are much shorter than the requested return period and also the climate is expected to change in the coming decades. Here we combine systematic- historical and paleo-information in an effort to improve flood frequency analysis and better understand potential linkages to both climate and non-climatic forcing. Specifically, we (i) compile historical flood data from the existing literature, (ii) produce high resolution X-ray fluorescence ({XRF}), Magnetic Susceptibility ({MS}) and Computed Tomography ({CT}) scanning data from a sediment core covering the last 10 300 years, and (iii) integrate these data sets in order to better estimate design floods and assess non-stationarities. Based on observations from Lake Flyginnsjøen, receiving sediments from Glomma only when it reaches a certain threshold, we can estimate flood frequency in a moving window of 50 years across millennia revealing that past flood frequency is non-stationary on different time scales. We observe that periods with increased flood activity (4000–2000 years ago and},

	abstract = {This paper presents the {SCHADEX} probabilistic method for extreme flood estimation, developed and applied since 2006 at Electricité de France ({EDF}) for dam spillway design. {SCHADEX} is based on a semi-continuous rainfall–runoff simulation process: a continuous hydrological simulation provides an exhaustive description of the possible hydrological states of the catchment, while floods are generated on an event basis. The method has been built around two models: the Multi-Exponential Weather Pattern ({MEWP}) distribution for rainfall probability estimation, and the {MORDOR} hydrological model. The simulation process allows the production of an estimated distribution of flood volumes at the study’s time step, as well as a distribution of flood peaks based on a peak-to-volume ratio computed from observed hydrographs of significant floods. A wide range of rainy events are simulated on each hydrological state, generating an exhaustive set of crossings between precipitation and soil saturation hazards. Consequently, {SCHADEX} stands clearly apart from the “N-years flood is generated by a N-years rainfall” paradigm, as a great diversity of hydrological scenarios can generate a flood of a given return period, with many variables taken into account. Since its development, {SCHADEX} has been widely applied in France for industrial studies, to catchments from several to several thousand square kilometres. This has allowed the testing and improvement of the method. In this paper, the basic concepts and hypothesis of the method are given in detail and illustrated throughout with the example of the River Tarn at Millau (2170km2, South of France). The different steps of the method are successively exposed, up to the estimated distribution of flood daily discharges and flood peaks and their comparison with observed values. Lastly, some methodological perspectives to enhance the method are presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Floods are a major natural hazard in the Mediterranean region, causing deaths and extensive damages. Recent studies have shown that intense rainfall events are becoming more extreme in this region, but paradoxically without leading to an increase in the severity of flood events. Consequently, it is important to understand how flood events are changing to explain this absence of trends in flood magnitude despite increased rainfall extremes. A database of 98 stations in Southern France with an average record of 50 years of daily river discharge data between 1958 and 2021 was considered, together with a high-resolution reanalysis product providing precipitation and simulated soil moisture. Flood events, corresponding to an average occurrence of one event per year (5317 events in total), were extracted and classified into excess rainfall, short rainfall and long rainfall event types. The evolution through time of the flood event characteristics and seasonality were analyzed. Results indicated that, in most basins, floods tend to occur earlier during the year, the mean flood date being on average advanced by one month. This seasonal shift can be attributed to the increased frequency of southern-circulation weather types during spring and summer. An increase in total and extreme event precipitation has been observed, associated with a decrease of antecedent soil moisture before rainfall events, linked to a smaller contribution of base flow during floods. The majority of flood events are associated with excess rainfall on saturated soils, but their relative proportion is decreasing over time with a concurrent increased frequency of short rain floods. Therefore, this study shows that even in the absence of trends, flood properties may change over time and these changes need to be accounted for when analyzing the long-term evolution of flood hazards.},

	abstract = {Concern over the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on flooding has led to a proliferation of studies examining past flood trends. Many studies have analysed annual-maximum flow trends but few have quantified changes in major (25–100year return period) floods, i.e. those that have the greatest societal impacts. Existing major-flood studies used a limited number of very large catchments affected to varying degrees by alterations such as reservoirs and urbanisation. In the current study, trends in major-flood occurrence from 1961 to 2010 and from 1931 to 2010 were assessed using a very large dataset ({\textgreater}1200gauges) of diverse catchments from North America and Europe; only minimally altered catchments were used, to focus on climate-driven changes rather than changes due to catchment alterations. Trend testing of major floods was based on counting the number of exceedances of a given flood threshold within a group of gauges. Evidence for significant trends varied between groups of gauges that were defined by catchment size, location, climate, flood threshold and period of record, indicating that generalizations about flood trends across large domains or a diversity of catchment types are ungrounded. Overall, the number of significant trends in major-flood occurrence across North America and Europe was approximately the number expected due to chance alone. Changes over time in the occurrence of major floods were dominated by multidecadal variability rather than by long-term trends. There were more than three times as many significant relationships between major-flood occurrence and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation than significant long-term trends.},

	doi = {10.1029/2019WR026575},
	abstract = {This paper proposes a method from Scan statistics for identifying flood-rich and flood-poor periods (i.e., anomalies) in flood discharge records. Exceedances of quantiles with 2-, 5-, and 10-year return periods are used to identify periods with unusually many (or few) threshold exceedances with respect to the reference condition of independent and identically distributed random variables. For the case of flood-rich periods, multiple window lengths are used in the identification process. The method is applied to 2,201 annual flood peak series in Europe between 1960 and 2010. Results indicate evidence for the existence of flood-rich and flood-poor periods, as about 2 to 3 times more anomalies are detected than what would be expected by chance. The frequency of the anomalies tends to decrease with an increasing threshold return period which is consistent with previous studies, but this may be partly related to the method and the record length of about 50 years. In the northwest of Europe, the frequency of stations with flood-rich periods tends to increase over time and the frequency of stations with flood-poor periods tends to decrease. In the east and south of Europe, the opposite is the case. There appears to exist a turning point around 1970 when the frequencies of anomalies start to change most clearly. This turning point occurs at the same time as a turning point of the North Atlantic Oscillation index. The method is also suitable for peak-over-threshold series and can be generalized to higher dimensions, such as space and space-time.},

	abstract = {{SHYREG} is a method developed for the regional knowledge of the flood discharges over different durations and for different return periods. The methodology consists of a hourly rainfall generator associated with a simple rainfall - runoff modelisation. It enables the simulation of long-term discharge data sets. Frequency distribution are drawn from these simulated series, thus allowing the evaluation of the discharge quantiles. This information is mapped with a resolution of 1 km2. The estimation of the discharge quantiles for a river basin requires to synthesise this continuous information. This led us to introduce the concept of a Statistical Transfer Function ({FTS} : Fonction de Transfert Statistique). It is then possible to give an estimation of the reference flood discharges in any point of the hydrographic network of the studied area. On the French Mediterranean Area, this regional methodology is based upon more than 500 raingauges and 220 watersheds. It leads to a good restitution of the discharge quantiles estimated from the observed series for return periods ranging between 2 and 100 years.},

	abstract = {Depuis 2006, Électricité de France ({EDF}) applique une nouvelle approche hydroclimatologique de prédétermination des pluies et crues extrêmes, la méthode {SCHADEX}, pour le dimensionnement des évacuateurs de crues de ses barrages. Dans un contexte de changement climatique global, potentiellement amplificateur de la fréquence et de l'intensité des événements extrêmes, l'application de la méthode {SCHADEX} en conditions non-stationnaires est un sujet d'intérêt majeur pour les hydrologues d'{EDF}. Aussi, l'objectif scientifique des travaux de thèse entrepris a été d'évaluer la capacité de la méthode {SCHADEX} à prendre en compte l'information contenue dans les simulations du climat futur, pour estimer les crues extrêmes du futur. Les difficultés avérées des modèles climatiques et des méthodes de descente d'échelles à simuler des distributions de pluies courantes et extrêmes à l'échelle d'un bassin versant ont été contournées, en développant et en testant de nouvelles approches méthodologiques. De plus, la décomposition des processus générateurs de crues extrêmes proposée par la méthode {SCHADEX} a été utilisée afin d'incorporer différentes évolutions climatiques simulées, et de quantifier l'impact relatif de ces processus sur l'estimation de débits extrêmes. La méthode {SCHADEX} a tout d'abord été appliquée en temps présent dans différents contextes climatiques (France, Autriche, Canada et Norvège), grâce à des collaborations avec plusieurs partenaires académiques et industriels. Une analyse de sensibilité des estimations de crues extrêmes à la variabilité climatique observée a été réalisée sur plusieurs bassins versants. Cette analyse a permis de quantifier, de manière indépendante, le degré de sensibilité des estimations à l'aléa pluie, à la saturation des bassins versants et à la transformation pluie-débit. Les résultats obtenus ont ainsi révélé la grande sensibilité des estimations {SCHADEX} à l'aléa pluie forte et à la transformation pluie-débit, réalisée par le modèle hydrologique. S'appuyant sur les résultats de l'analyse de sensibilité, des travaux ont ensuite été réalisés afin d'estimer les évolutions futures des variables clés préalablement identifiées. Des sorties récentes de modèles climatiques (réalisées dans le cadre du projet {CMIP}5) ont été analysées, et ont permis de déterminer des fréquences d'occurrences futures d'épisodes pluvieux, ainsi que des conditions futures de saturation des bassins versants. L'incorporation de ces séries au sein de la méthode {SCHADEX} entraîne une diminution non négligeable des débits de crues extrêmes estimés. Dans le but de prédire l'intensité des pluies futures à partir de simulations de températures de l'air, des tests ont été entrepris sur plusieurs centaines de pluies de bassin françaises, afin de relier les températures de l'air observées avec les intensités de pluies extrêmes observées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent une augmentation moyenne de 6\% des quantiles de pluies extrêmes par degré d'augmentation de la température de l'air, au pas de temps journalier. Néanmoins, des tests supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour déterminer sur quelles gammes de températures, et à quel pas de temps cette augmentation est valable. Enfin, ces différentes évolutions futures ont été toutes incorporées au sein de la méthode {SCHADEX}. Cet exercice final a montré la difficulté de quantifier l'impact du changement climatique sur les crues extrêmes, du fait de processus qui s'additionnent (diminution des débits extrêmes due à la fois à l'évolution des fréquences d'occurrences d'épisodes pluvieux et à l'évolution des conditions de saturation des bassins versants) et d'autres qui s'opposent (augmentation des débits extrêmes due à l'augmentation de l'intensité future des épisodes pluvieux). Si l'analyse de sensibilité des estimations de crues extrêmes a soulevé de nombreuses questions relatives au calage du modèle hydrologique utilisé dans la méthode {SCHADEX}, la quantification de l'intensité des épisodes pluvieux futurs constitue l'enjeu clé de la prédétermination des pluies et crues extrêmes en contexte de changement climatique.},

          , 
            Many studies have sought to constrain climate projections based on recent observations. Until recently, these constraints had limited impact, and projected warming ranges were driven primarily by model outputs. Here, we use the newest climate model ensemble, improved observations, and a new statistical method to narrow uncertainty on estimates of past and future human-induced warming. Cross-validation suggests that our method produces robust results and is not overconfident. We derive consistent observationally constrained estimates of attributable warming to date and warming rate, the response to a range of future scenarios, and metrics of climate sensitivity. We find that historical observations narrow uncertainty on projected future warming by about 50\%. Our results suggest that using an unconstrained multimodel ensemble is no longer the best choice for global mean temperature projections and that the lower end of previous estimates of 21st century warming can now be excluded.},

Globally, relatively few instrumental river flow series extend beyond 50 years, with short records presenting significant challenges in determining flood risk from high-magnitude floods. A perceived increase in extreme floods in recent years has decreased public confidence in conventional flood risk estimates; the results affect society (insurance costs), individuals (personal vulnerability) and companies (e.g. water resource managers). Here, we show how historical records from Britain have improved understanding of high-magnitude floods, by examining past spatial and temporal variability. The findings identify that whilst recent floods are notable, several comparable periods of increased flooding are identifiable historically, with periods of greater frequency (flood-rich periods). Statistically significant relationships between the British flood index, the Atlantic Meridional Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index are identified. The use of historical records identifies that the largest floods often transcend single catchments affecting regions and that the current flood-rich period is not unprecedented.},

A series of {CFD} simulations, using {MAillé} {GEnéralisé} ({MAGE}), are employed to compute the flood extent resulting from the overflow of rivers. These simulated outputs are affected by uncertainties in the empiric roughness coefficients. Uncertainty propagation in {MAGE} outputs is difficult to evaluate because of the complexity and the nonlinearity of models. Assessment of uncertainties may be carried out by computing derivatives of the output results with respect to the inputs. Recently, automatic differentiation ({AD}) has become an efficient numerical method for sensitivity analysis and assessment of uncertainties. In this paper, {AD} is used to transform mechanically a given one-dimensional hydraulic model, {MAGE}, into a new program capable of computing the original simulation and the desired derivatives. Specifically, derivatives of the flood extent and the water width with respect to the roughness coefficients are computed. Numerical experiments of derivatives obtained from {AD} and divided difference ({DD}) approximations are compared, validating derivatives obtained by {AD}. Results can serve to evaluate existing flood models.},

	url = {https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-02602195},
	abstract = {The Rhône River, from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea (545 km) is regulated by twenty-one hydropower schemes. In most of hydropower schemes, the natural Rhône River is diverted through a bypass canal where the hydropower plant and a lock are located. A diversion dam is constructed in the old natural Rhône to manage floods and control the water discharge in the bypass canal. The hydropower scheme's operation rules include a minimum compensation discharge in the old natural Rhône and a maximum discharge in the bypass canal as allowed by the hydropower plant. Meanwhile, the maximum water level in the reservoir is imposed as a function of the inflow discharge at a so-called “Regulation Point” located upstream of the hydropower scheme. The objective of the present paper is to investigate the modeling of hydropower scheme's operation rules in the Rhône River. A 1D hydrodynamic model, based on the 1D shallow water equations, has been developed that includes the hydropower schemes' operation rules. It is used to simulate two major hydro-sedimentary events with high suspended sediment transport, with different operation rules applied (usual / exceptional). Hydraulic schemes parameters, such as physical characteristics of gates and different types of operation rules are discussed, as well as differences in results when automatic or temporal operation rules are used in the model. The final aim of this model is to improve the numerical simulation and the understanding of hydro-sedimentary and pollution processes in the Rhône River.},

The diagnosis is conducted using the Jones equation, a simple hydraulic concept relating discharge to stage and its time-gradient. The input data used for the method are the flow resistance coefficients, the temporal stage gradients, and the bed slopes. The hysteresis effect is quantified for each gauging station and mapped using the relative discharge error. The method was applied to 2618 gauging stations of France’s national hydrometry network using data extracted from the national hydrological archive and from Digital Terrain Models. The diagnostic results highly depend on slope estimates used as inputs. Substantial hysteresis effects were found at stations with low bed slope combined with a fast flood regime. The application to France shows the difficulty of drawing a firm conclusion about stations prone to hysteresis due to the slope data uncertainty. This issue is not specific to France; slope estimates over a network of hydrometric stations are difficult to obtain in many countries. The use of local bed slope estimates is recommended to approach the slopes of the reaches controlling the station stage-discharge relation.},

	abstract = {The magnitudes of the largest known floods of the River Rhine in Basel since 1268 were assessed using a hydraulic model drawing on a set of pre-instrumental evidence and daily hydrological measurements from 1808. The pre-instrumental evidence, consisting of flood marks and documentary data describing extreme events with the customary reference to specific landmarks, was “calibrated” by comparing it with the instrumental series for the overlapping period between the two categories of evidence (1808–1900). Summer ({JJA}) floods were particularly frequent in the century between 1651–1750, when precipitation was also high. Severe winter ({DJF}) floods have not occurred since the late 19th century despite a significant increase in winter precipitation. Six catastrophic events involving a runoff greater than 6000 m 3 s‐1 are documented prior to 1700. They were initiated by spells of torrential rainfall of up to 72 h (1480 event) and preceded by long periods of substantial precipitation that saturated the soils, and/or by abundant snowmelt. All except two (1999 and 2007) of the 43 identified severe events ({SEs}: defined as having runoff {\textgreater} 5000 and {\textless} 6000 m 3 s ‐1) occurred prior to 1877. Not a single {SE} is documented from 1877 to 1998. The intermediate 121-year-long “flood disaster gap” is unique over the period since 1268. The effect of river regulations (1714 for the River Kander; 1877 for the River Aare) and the building of reservoirs in the 20th century upon peak runoff were investigated using a one-dimensional hydraulic flood-routing model. Results show that anthropogenic effects only partially account for the “flood disaster gap” suggesting that variations in climate should also be taken into account in explaining these features.

	abstract = {A method was designed to study frequency distributions of hydrologic variables (rainfall and discharge) which combined a stochastic model for hourly rainfall with a general conceptual model for transforming rainfall into discharge. The model generates many different flood events over a given simulation period to evaluate hydrologic risks. The Simulated Hydrographs for flood Probability Estimation ({SHYPRE}) method was based on the use of observations to describe phenomena and statistically reproduce them. Frequency distributions of hydrological variables are built empirically from simulated rainfall and flood events. Extrapolation of these frequency distributions toward rare frequencies is performed by generating very different events over a long simulation period rather than by directly fitting a theoretical probability distribution on observed values. This method yields an original estimation of flood quantiles from common to rare frequencies and provides complete temporal data about these floods. In addition, the approach supplies more stable estimates of flood quantiles than statistical distributions fitted on observed values, even for frequent events. This is due to a better integration of rainfall data and the parametric design stability of the two models (rainfall model and rainfall-discharge model).},

For the normal distribution the limiting distribution has h = 0.From the normal distribution the limiting distribution is approached with extreme slowness; the final series of forms passed through as the ultimate form is approached may be represented by the series of limiting distributions in which h tends to zero in a definite manner as n increases to infinity.Numerical values are given for the comparison of the actual with the penultimate distributions for samples of 60 to 1000, and of the penultimate with the ultimate distributions for larger samples.},

Large-scale atmospheric forcing has been found to play an important role in these topics and attention has been renewed in climatic indices that can be used as a proxy for atmospheric variability. Among them, the North Atlantic oscillation, the East Atlantic or the East Atlantic–West Russia patterns have been widely addressed but much less attention has been devoted to a Mediterranean mode, the Mediterranean oscillation. This overview summarizes the recent advances that have been achieved in the understanding of these climatic indices and their influence on the functioning of the Mediterranean from a physical point of view. The important role of the Mediterranean oscillation is emphasized and the most relevant aspects of the other indices are revisited and discussed.},

While the effects in the Pacific–North American sector and the tropical regions are relatively well understood, the impacts on the circulation in the North Atlantic–European sector are discussed more controversially. Studies from the past 10 years demonstrate that {ENSO} does affect European climate. However, some of the effects undergo a seasonal modulation or are nonlinear. The signal can be modified by other factors and might be nonstationary on multidecadal scales, contributing to a large interevent variability. Here I review observational and model-based evidence for {ENSO}'s effect on European climate and discuss possible mechanisms, also including troposphere-stratosphere coupling. The paper ends with a schematic depiction of the effects and a discussion of their relevance with respect to our scientific understanding of the climate system and of their relevance for seasonal climate forecasts.},

	abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background ‘first guess’ fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2° spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational {NWP} forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific–North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century.

	abstract = {European flood frequency and intensity change on a multidecadal scale. Floods were more frequent in the 19th (central Europe) and early 20th century (western Europe) than during the mid-20th century and again more frequent since the 1970s. The causes of this variability are not well understood and the relation to climate change is unclear. Palaeoclimate studies from the northern Alps suggest that past flood-rich periods coincided with cold periods. In contrast, some studies suggest that more floods might occur in a future, warming world. Here we address the contribution of atmospheric circulation and of warming to multidecadal flood variability. For this, we use long series of annual peak streamflow, daily weather data, reanalyses, and reconstructions. We show that both changes in atmospheric circulation and moisture content affected multidecadal changes of annual peak streamflow in central and western Europe over the past two centuries. We find that during the 19th and early 20th century, atmospheric circulation changes led to high peak values of moisture flux convergence. The circulation was more conducive to strong and long-lasting precipitation events than in the mid-20th century. These changes are also partly reflected in the seasonal mean circulation and reproduced in atmospheric model simulations, pointing to a possible role of oceanic variability. For the period after 1980, increasing moisture content in a warming atmosphere led to extremely high moisture flux convergence. Thus, the main atmospheric driver of flood variability changed from atmospheric circulation variability to water vapour increase.},

The Ardèche River is ideal for this historical flood-paleoflood study because its historical flood levels record dates back as early as A.D. 587 and useful data date back to A.D. 1522, its systematic gauging record is over 100 years long, and the geologic and geomorphic settings are optimal for paleoflood studies. Three sites provide three different thresholds for flood stages and {SWD} accumulation. According to our one-dimensional (1-D) step-backwater calculations these three thresholds are 5200–5700 m3 s−1, 4900–5400 m3 s−1, and 3600–4000 m3 s−1 recording 6, 9, and 19 large Holocene floods, respectively. Dating the deposits enabled a correlation with the historical record. These paleoflood studies indicate that there are long gaps in flood occurrences on the Ardèche River; the floods are not randomly distributed in time but are clustered. They also indicate that the recent nineteenth century floods were the largest at the millennial timescale.},

However, the network of flood mark sites is distinct from the network of hydrometric stations, making this information difficult to use. This work describes a probabilistic model jointly describing flood marks at sites and flood peaks at stations. The model is based on the estimation of Hidden Climate Indices driving both flood marks and peaks: this allows transferring information between the two variables despite them being measured on distinct networks. The model is applied to about 300 flood mark sites (1705-2015) and 200 stations (1904-2015) in France. Results demonstrate that flood marks allow estimating the time-varying probability of exceeding some high discharge threshold at stations during the whole period 1705-2015, which largely predates the existence of stations. The resulting probability maps provide quantitative information on the extent and spatial structure of ancient floods.},

	abstract = {Paleoflood studies are an effective means of providing specific information on the recurrence and magnitude of rare and large floods. Such information can be combined with systematic flood measurements to better assess the frequency of large floods. Paleoflood data also provide valuable information about the linkages among climate, land use, flood-hazard assessments, and channel morphology. This document summarizes methods and techniques for the preparation, gathering, evaluation, and interpretation of paleoflood information, including uncertainties, especially with respect to new statistical approaches available to efficiently use such data. We summarize best practices and strategies for assessing and mitigating uncertainties and provide guidelines on appropriate technical review of paleoflood analyses based on project goals and requirements....},
